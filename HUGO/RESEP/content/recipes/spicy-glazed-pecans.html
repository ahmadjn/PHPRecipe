    <b>Shae&#039;s Mama</b> - I&#039;ve been looking for a sweet &amp; spicy nut recipe that doesn&#039;t use butter or egg whites (so they&#039;ll keep longer)...and this one is really nice!  I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and I&#039;m glad I did.  I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 teaspoon based on other reviews, but then it was barely detectable at all.  Next time I will definitely add the full 1/2 teaspoon...and I&#039;m not one for a lot of cayenne.  I reduced the oven temp down to 325 degrees to try and avoid the burning that other reviews mentioned, but mine still burnt a bit on the bottom.  Next time I&#039;ll lower it down to 300 degrees and check them at 12 minutes instead of 15.  I also used parchment paper (not foil) and had no problem with the nuts sticking.  I plan on making these again for holiday gift giving...Thanks!

    <b>MissBridget</b> - These make an AMAZING salad topper!  I added in a few pinches of sea salt, ended up with a sweet, spicey &amp; salty treat!  Perfect on my baby spinach salad, with a homemade honey, bacon and mandarin dressing, red onions, mushrooms, and crumbled goat cheese....Mmmmmm mmmmm!!!!! Friends say it&#039;s straight out of an upscale restaurant :)

    <b>kyalowitz</b> - These were EXCELLENT and really easy. I have another recipe that is much more complicated. I followed others&#039; comments and added 1/2 tsp salt and only used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper because my family does not like spicy food. Also, I would recommend spraying the aluminum foil with cooking spray.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ENGARDE68</b> - What a great taste! I can&#039;t stop eating these pecans. I used Splenda instead of the sugar and (hopefully) reduced the calories.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Georgia Yankee</b> - One of the best pecan recipes I have tried. I don&#039;t like egg whites and this was just what I was looking for. These are a great post-workout snack and I use them on my salads. Yummy! One note - you must let them carmelize in the oven or they will turn out grainy. They won&#039;t burn if you keep an eye on them! I stirred them every few minutes after the sugar started to brown. If you take them out too soon they will be grainy!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JULIANNE0009</b> - Easy and fast. I added cinnamon to the sugar mixture and sprinkled sea salt over the pecans before putting them in the oven. I put them in for 15 minutes exactly and they came out slightly burned. I would recommend 12 minutes
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Maycat</b> - This was very good. I didn&#039;t use as much cayenne because the people I was making this sald for didn&#039;t like spicy food. Next time I would lower the temperature to 300 because some of the smaller thinner pecans were overcooked and burning after 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Also some became glazed (caramelized) and some didn&#039;t. I will definitely use this again for my next salad.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Johanna WISHES she were a</b> - Excellent! I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla then added 4 dashes of ground cloves and nutmeg. Quick easy and delicious and I&#039;m making for 3 families at Christmas! Thanks for the recipe this one&#039;s a keeper!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>foodNwine</b> - AWESOME and addicting!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ahoward923</b> - This recipe is not my favorite. Maybe I baked them too long but the pecans turned out a little too crispy and they tasted bland even with the cayenne pepper.
