    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - Super simple and super satisfying! I do not have a pressure cooker so I went the slow cooker method. Excellent! I think a lot of the success has to do with the enchilada sauce you use. That leading brand we all know...skip it. Go with an off brand imported from Mexico (typically cheaper too). I used it for years but that leading brand has a metallic twang to it that is no good. The imported brands have a flat taste to them and more depth of flavor. I chose to skip some of the topping to cut down on fat. I used red onion cilantro and cheese and that is all that I needed. Tortilla strips sour cream and avocado would have been nice but avocados are an arm and a leg and the others were unnecessary fat for me so I left them out. You really can&#039;t go wrong with this one and it would be easily adaptable to suit a vegetarian. I enjoyed this one on many levels and I know soup. Thank you!

    <b>Pam</b> - Yum. Using up ingredients before a big household move. I used 2 cans chicken green chili enchilada sauce. Heated on the stove instead of in a pressure cooker since the chicken was already cooked. Quick and easy.

    <b>Mc-chef</b> - This is the maybe the 4th or 5th recipe i&#039;ve done in my InstantPot... it is DELICIOUS!! I made it exactly as recipe is written topped with snipped cilantro shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream - SO GOOD!!

    <b>Linda</b> - My husband thought the soup was good but for me it was too spicy. I used medium enchilada sauce and did not add the green chilies. Next time I would add mild enchilada sauce and add the green chilies. It just depends on how spicy you like it.
