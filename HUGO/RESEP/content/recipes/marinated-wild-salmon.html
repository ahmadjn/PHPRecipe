    <b>Sharon</b> - this was PHENOMENAL!!!!  I just dumped all the ingredients in a big plastic bag and marinated the salmon 6 hours and it was SOOOO delicious!!!  very fresh, rich tasting.  I added the juice of 2 limes instead of lemon and added about 2 tsps of chili pepper.  I used regular balsamic instead of white and it still all came out fabulous!  I grilled mine in a pan and cooked the remaining marinade in a small sauce pan until it boiled and added a little cornstarch to thicken it- truly made the dish!

    <b>Michelle Bonham</b> - This dish is so delicious!!! I love salmon, and this is one of the best recipes. I have to say it is great broiled, but it is simply wonderful on the grill. I marinated the whole fillet with the skin and put it on some foil and it was great.***Update***I used some leftovers to make salmon patties &amp; it was out of this world! Simply mix with seasoned bread crumbs, beaten egg, diced onion, green peppers, spices &amp; brown in the skillet. Excellent!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Michelle Ramey</b> - This was good, I really enjoyed the cilantro flavor.  We had it with grilled asparagus, grilled orange peppers, and some garlic bread.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Missuzj</b> - Best salmon I have ever eaten. The only changes I made were to omit the red pepper flakes and substitute white wine vinegar for the white balsamic (couldn&#039;t find it). Also I cooked mine on the grill. I highly recommend it.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>andreax101</b> - It was easy to make! and the dish was delicious! I added extra cilantro and green onions, used 1 tbsp red wine vinegar, and half the amount of white balsamic vinegar. I don&#039;t have a broiler, so I just baked the salmon uncovered on 450 for about 17 minutes. I marinated for only 2 hours and it still was fantastic!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jesus loves You!</b> - This was an excellent flavor for Salmon! I followed exactly - my demise though was it was over cooked. I think the total cooking time is 10 min but was unsure the way it was written. I cooked for 15...too much:( Still a great recipe though! Thanks!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>YOGABLISS78</b> - Great recipe. Tastes awsome on the grill. The only thing i left out was the cilantro and it was still delicious! I always use this marinade for salmon now when bbq&#039;ing.

    <b>Brittany Robertson</b> - I recently got married and have been trying out new recipes on my husband and he LOVED this one! He ate so much of it that when we went to the gym later on he felt sick. But never regretted eating the yummy salmon. It was very moist flavorful and easy to prepare. The only disappointing part about it was that it has to marinate for so long because once you smell it you want to eat it right away!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JADEDZZ</b> - YUM! This recipe is effortless and can be done within minutes. Great last minute fix! (though the suggested marinating time is ideal) Healthy and satisfying =)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MBCORNS</b> - I really didn&#039;t like this. It was a little too sweet and lemony for my taste.
