    <b>Candace Davidson</b> - Great recipe!! We didn&#039;t use onion or red pepper flakes because we had spicy Italian sausage (and it was spicy!). Will do again using sweet Italian sausage and hopefully it won&#039;t be as fire engine hot as this was.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>thedailygourmet</b> - This was so fast to make and I love how most ingredients were fresh! Kudos on not having a lot of processed ingredients! I omitted the salt, as I wanted the taste to come from the herbs. Other than that I followed the recipe. Yum yum!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sherry Maxwell</b> - Delicious! Used Johnsonville cooked Italian sausage and minced garlic. Definitely a favorite
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>momto3</b> - My family devoured this! We are not hot and spicy fans so I omitted the red pepper flakes. I also used 2 tsp of minced garlic and no garlic salt. I added 4 large handfuls of spinach and a full 750ml jar of pasta sauce. I also drained the diced tomatoes so it wasn&#039;t runny at all. It was quick easy and a new family favourite!

    <b>Bren</b> - This was wonderful! I didn&#039;t have a green pepper so I used a yellow and I was out of tomato sauce so I used crushed it made the dish really creamy. The pasta I undercooked by a few minutes and added it to the pan after draining it with everything else to soak up the sauce. Thanks for sharing.

    <b>LINDA</b> - This recipe was outstanding! I only had Trader Joe’s chicken sausage.  Since there is no casing, I sliced the sausage into “pennies” and it turned out so delicious.  Will definitely make it again and will use the same sausage...
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>eswimlake</b> - Fresh and tasty! I used chicken sausage to cut down on the fat and it was still flavorful. It made a big pot so we are looking forward to leftovers.
