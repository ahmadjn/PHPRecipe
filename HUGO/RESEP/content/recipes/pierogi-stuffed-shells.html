    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - Made as written and these turned out good. You the real bacon bits and not the imitation. The fresh onions were good but there was plenty of onion flavor going on with the dried ones so I would probably skip that step the next time.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Delicate Flower</b> - These were wonderful. Thank you for sending this recipe! We didn’t sauté the onions or use them. We left those out. Very flavorful and I think they will become a staple. The recipe made 22 shells. The only problem I had was that I made them with my grandkids. They liked them so much and kept eating “one” there was barely enough left for grandpa’s dinner. Now that is a great recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>FoodisLove</b> - The flavors were good but it was far to rich for our tastes.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>BRG</b> - Used real mashed potatoes for the filling and added sour cream.
