        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>DEVSOL</b> - I should have noted that I use Kame fish sauce. It is 27% salt instead of 50% for the others. Just the right amount in a 140 ml. bottle.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Caroline C</b> - This was ok. I think maybe I should have used a really good quality wine. I used run-of-the-mill plonk and the flavor suffered as a result. Also the carrots were a little strange. I probably won&#039;t make this again but thanks anyway.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kristin Palombo</b> - I used a whole head of garlic instead of one clove. Also added shallots. Use half the amount of cream - they are still creamy and delicious just not so heavy. And some diced tomatoes tossed on top as a garnish is nice.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LouisvilleHugger</b> - I really liked this!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>k861084</b> - My boyfriend called this meal the &quot;best meal I&#039;ve ever made&quot;! haha
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>mary</b> - I have made this dish twice for different folks and its a big hit! Very easy and very tasty.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Chris J</b> - Use a low sodium fish stock was pretty good but will try another mussel recipe next time
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KINGPIN2</b> - This was really good! I served it over linguini for our anniversary dinner which worked well but the pasta wasn&#039;t really necessary. A definite keeper.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Miss T</b> - The sauce was okay. Mine turned out a bit watery for a creamy broth although I did use a good wine. I also probably won&#039;t try this one again either.
    </li>
        </ul>
