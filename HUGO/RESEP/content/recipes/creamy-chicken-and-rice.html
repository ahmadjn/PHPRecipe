    <b>KELLYGOFF</b> - This was some good stuff. Of course, I can never follow a recipe to the &quot;T&quot;. I always tweak something in it. I cooked the rice in the poaching liquid from the chicken, I threw in some shredded cheddar along with the veveeta, tossed in some frozen peas and carrots and topped in all off with some french fried onions instead of the cracker crumbs. My kids went nuts over it and my husband got up in the morning and ate it for breakfast. He said it was even better reheated. Thanx for a great recipe...this one is a keeper.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Cheryl Bricks</b> - This was very good, and a very creamy delightful switch from the usual run of the mill &quot;Chicken &amp; Rice&quot; recipes.
But I have got to say after making it a few times I tried a more gourmet tasting flair to it and it worked beautifully.  What I used was 1/2 gruyere cheese and 1/2 good cheddar.
Then I diced 4 large chicken breast halves into small bite size pieces and placed  approx. 3 cups of large sliced fresh mushooms in a bowl and sprinkled 1/3 cup of white wine on top and tossed the mushrooms and chicken to absorb the wine and let sit while I prepared the cheese sauce.
I also prepared the rice using the water I had boiled the breasts in and strained it and added some chicken base.
I would definitly serve this for company done this way and recommend having fun using the basics of this recipe to your own tastes. It is a keeper!!!

    <b>Vahna Kuska</b> - This recipe was not a very big hit with the family. I tried it again without the Velveeta and used cheddar also did it with uncooked rice and baked longer. this seemed to have added more flavor to the rice. My famiily liked this version more.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jennifer Fisher</b> - Good but I also added broccoli celery and onion to the chicken mixture. In addition I took out the chicken bullion and used garlic and onion powder with the seasoning salt. For the topping I halved the cracker crumbs and added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to them for the topping. I also took out the butter which was not needed once the cheese was added I used sharp chedder instead of the velveta. I think the combo of velveta bullion and seasoning salt would add way to much salt to this dish. With the changes I belive it is a 5 star recipe but a 4 as written

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>tswartze</b> - Great first out of the oven when re-heated I felt it was too dry maybe the rice soaks up the extra liquid. Next time will add more sour cream or something to make it have a little more liquid.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>DREGINEK</b> - A classic home-cooked comfort food dinner! I didn&#039;t add the cooked chicken to the sauce (so that I could stir it better/smoother) but just mixed it in ahead with the rice (Step one or two). Also I took another&#039;s advice about adding veggies: I added some cooked chopped broccoli &amp; cooked chopped carrots. Overall - an easy dinner that we all thought was terriffic! Thanks!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tricia-M</b> - I always read the reviews before trying a new recipe and use the suggestions that sound good. I tried the gruyere cheese Cheryl B suggested what a delicious cheese! I sautéed onions and celery with chicken tenders then added the rest of the ingredients. I also skipped the bouillon and used a carton of chicken broth using 2 cups in the rice and substituting the other 2 cups for the milk. This casserole came out delicious!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>VIPSTER</b> - Really very good taste! Nice and creamy! It is missing something though lacks color. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d add anything in the recipe per se but having peas and carrots on the side to mix in would be awesome. I would also put more of a crust on it--another cup or so of crackers should be fine since my topping seemed a little wet anyway. Overall really good though. Now that I know the taste I can figure out what veggies to make on the side(see above) and make it a comlete meal. ENJOY!

    <b>BAKININBUDAPEST</b> - Tasty tasty! Used Durkee&#039;s fried onions instead of crackers. Cooked rice in chicken broth. Added cooked mixed vegetables. Chopped cooked chicken rather than shredded it. Mixed shredded colby jack and cheddar cheeses in with the cheese sauce. Only had about one cup of sour cream and it still worked out well. My son doesn&#039;t eat meat so made a portion for him without meat in one tray. A guest doesn&#039;t eat onions so put the crunchy onion topping only on part of it. Easy to adapt for nearly all picky eaters at the same table! Will definitely make again! Thanks!
