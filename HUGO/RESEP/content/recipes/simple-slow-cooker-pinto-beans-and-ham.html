    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - Made as directed and these turned out good. A little thin but that is how I like my beans. These were simple and I liked that they were basic so that people can top them with whatever they want or nothing at all. My bowl got a generous shake of hot pepper sauce, chopped raw onion, and a splash of vinegar.
