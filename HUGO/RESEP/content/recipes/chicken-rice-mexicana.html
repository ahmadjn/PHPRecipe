    <b>snugglepunkin</b> - I liked this recipe, however I made a few alterations that really helped.  First, I grilled strips of chicken breasts instead of cubed chicken using my George Foreman (took 5 min!) and then when layering it, I added spoonfuls of salsa over the rice.  I also used cheddar instead of jack, and it worked very well. I ate mine with sour cream and extra salsa.  This has a fajita casserole taste to it, which isn&#039;t my hubby&#039;s favorite thing but he liked it, especially in the times I have made it since, where I chop the peppers and onion up smaller so they&#039;re less noticeable. Even my toddler daughter eats it!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>VALERILYNN</b> - I changed the recipe a little because I read the reviews that said it need something else.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken and 4 cups of rice.  Two cups of rice didn&#039;t seem to be enough.  I still used the same amount of milk and cream of mushroom soup.  The thing that made the big difference was that I added a package of taco seasoning to my chicken before I added the soup and milk.  I made it a second time and added a can of diced green chilies.  Sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top of the monterey jack.  Try it this way and you will love it.  A good recipe to play with and change around. Thanks.

    <b>BANGER5</b> - This was a great recipe!!!!! I did make some major changes. First I used spanish rice from a box. Then I put chilies cuman and cilantro to the chicken mixture. My husband put sourcream on his. This was creamy and really good. I will make this again for sure.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Crankybug</b> - I was the original poster of this recipe YEARS ago (before they even registered users) and I see that there is an ingredient that was omitted. It is supposed to have a package of taco seasoning added with the soup and milk. I saw at least one reviewer who suggested that change. :) I love all the ideas and suggestions from others, too. It&#039;s just what is great about AllRecipes.

    <b>Angie Kovacs</b> - This is FANTASTIC! The only thing we did differently was to use pepperjack cheese instead of just regular jack (we like spice) and used more cheese than it called for. This was absolutely to die for! One of my favorite finds ever!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Todzwif</b> - Great quick dinner! I used a bagged frozen pepper/onion blend added some corn and used Cream of Chicken instead of mushroom. Also threw in a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. When it was served I crumbled tortilla chips on top and added a dollup of sour cream. I think I&#039;ll try it in the crock pot next time and throw in the rice when I get home after work!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MMOH</b> - This was good stuff. I did tweak it a bit though. I sauteed my chicken with the peppers and onions and then sprinkled it all with Taco Seasoning I (from this site). I also used pepper jack cheese and mixed the chicken mixture into the rice rather than layering it. I loved how simple this was to prepare and I&#039;ll definitely be making it again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KENDAHLJ</b> - I had some leftover rice and a green pepper I needed to use up so I picked this recipe. It was very easy to make and it tasted pretty good. I used green onions because my wife doesn&#039;t like regular onions. With a little effort we got our kids to eat it even with the peppers. I think it probably needs something else -- maybe corn or peas or some other veggies and definitely more spices. But overall it was quick easy and tasty.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Run2Eat</b> - Tried it but used vegetables I had on hand peas carrots and corn. And didn&#039;t have white rice had brown rice. Came out good. Added salsa for extra kick. Will make this again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KSUZY</b> - This recipe was just okay. There was way too much rice in it which made it taste a little bland. After you cook the rice and the chicken mixture it&#039;s basically finished. You don&#039;t need to bake it in layers with the cheese on top IF you are going to put it in tortillas as the recipe suggests-- it just adds cooking time and not much else. You can instead mix some rice in with the chicken mixture (not as much as recipe suggests) put in tortillas and put shredded cheese on top.
