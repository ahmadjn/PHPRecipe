    <b>Jewel Love</b> - This recipe is so different - I just had to try it. The shrimp was a great addition to an old standby. I also added cumin and bacon and cooked the potatoes in bacon grease - YUM!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">

    <b>Lamaha</b> - Not as good as I expected it to be. Was edible and not bad but for all the prep time and cook time involved I thought it would be better. Won&#039;t make this again. Also recipe was bland and that is coming from someone who does not eat much salt.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Michelle Aguilar</b> - This recipe was okay. It was certainly hearty but having seen the reviews I followed the recipe to the letter yet added cumin basil salt pepper and coriander powder as well and I have to say it was still verging on bland. Don&#039;t think that for the work involved to deliciousness ratio I would make it again.
