        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Justin Kraemer</b> - If I could give this a 6th star, I probably would. Definitely was easier to have two of us working together to make the dish. But it was incredibly good.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Johanna Mills</b> - I enjoyed this.  Next time I may add some peas, small broccoli, diced carrots.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jennifer Hellmuth</b> - It was pretty good. I would not call it fast. I used rotisserie chicken and fresh bacon. Everyone at the tablet liked it but its not the first pick due to the multiple pans and time it took.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Bobbie Stucki</b> - Added chopped broccoli and cauliflower. Yummy
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Beverly</b> - Very good recipe for using leftover roasted chicken breasts. My husband loved it! He took leftovers to work for lunch as well. I loved it too! At first I thought 8 slices of bacon would be too much so I only cooked 5 slices. Should have stuck to the recipe and used all 8. Oh well there&#039;s always next time!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Alyssa Nicole</b> - This was delicious! I have been looking to change up my pasta bakes and this one was definitely a winner! I think the only change I made was adding more bacon on top.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lauri Wasson</b> - We all loved this! Thanks for a great recipe. The only thing I did different was I used pepper jack, only because I didn’t have Monterey.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Roger Penn</b> - Fantastic! Going to be making this one a lot.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Brandy Johnson</b> - It was delicious,  definitely a keeper! I made minor modifications;added onion and sweet peppers, and added a small can of corn. 
The family loved it and it was a fast,complete meal.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
