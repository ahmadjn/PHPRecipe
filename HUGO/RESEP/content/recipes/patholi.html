    <b>Mary M.</b> - Flavors are good but mine required about double the cooking time and I never did manage to turn the dal into a &quot;paste &quot; even after 8 hours of soaking. We ended up with a tasty chana dal dish but I assume the texture was &quot;wrong&quot; since I never achieved that paste. I might make this again even so.
