    <b>Wendy</b> - This is a great recipe because it&#039;s easy AND it&#039;s good!  I always cut the amount of sugar in cakes, and cut this to 1 cup sugar only and it was fine (unless you have a very sweet tooth).  I made it first with too much applesauce (to finish the jar I had), and it came out way too dense although my children loved it.  When I made it a second time with the right amount of applesauce, the consistency was pefect.  I also sprinkled the top with a sugar and cinnamon mixture before it baked and it made the cake look nice without any frosting.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>TTN</b> - WONDERFUL!! Quick, easy, moist and delicious. I cut the recipe in half -cooking for one- and used an 8&quot; sq pan, baked for 40 min, but next time I&#039;ll probably use the full recipe and freeze half. I used a simple vanilla glaze and spread over a still warm cake. Even had some for breakfast this morning- after all it does contain fruit.
    </li>

    <b>karenlee62</b> - Everyone LOVES this recipe! It alwasy comes out perfectly. May suggest slightly undercook by 1-2 minutes. Great for kids too...the cake itself is not overly sweet and does not need icing although is does taste yummy either way. Simple directions basically...a no fail delicious cake.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PROVONCHEE</b> - I forgot to add to my previous review - I omitted the nuts in the cake and added instead organic raisins soaked in rum for 24 hours.  I also used maple frosting (confectioners sugar frosting with mostly cream cheese, a little bit of butter, a dab of milk and some maple flavoring.)  A delicious combination!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MORUPE</b> - Very moist and tasty.  Instead of using a 9 x 13 pan, I filled 6 individual bundt pans plus 6 cupcakes and baked for about 20 minutes (till toothpick came out clean).  I served this on Thanksgiving.  See the photo of how the little cakes were decorated.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JANEBNC</b> - This was a very flavorful and tasty cake. I would definitely make it again. However my cooking time differed drastically from the recipe. My cake was done in 25 minutes.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>leahnwells</b> - This cake has great flavor and texture. Very moist and delicious. However, a cream cheese frosting would, in my opinion, be too overwhelming. Instead, I used a simple caramel glaze (1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. light brown sugar, 1 tbsp. milk or cream; bring to boil over medium heat then glaze cake). Everyone loved this cake with the caramel glaze. In the future, since I omitted the pecan cream cheese frosting, I would add more walnuts to the cake itself.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Caroline</b> - This cake is moist and delicious - a complete crowd pleaser. I had to leave out the walnuts because I can&#039;t eat them and was going to substitute pecans but realized I had none so that will be my next attempt at this recipe. The only thing I changed besides that was to add just a bit of nutmeg because it just seemed to be begging to be in there! Excellent recipe a winner all the way. This one is definitely going into the family recipe album!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KPRICE</b> - Very good cake. We liked the flavor of the cake and the nuts in the frosting. But the frosting was a little too sweet.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Judi Leaming</b> - Just okay... I&#039;ve had better.
