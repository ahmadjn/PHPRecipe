    <b>Sue Williamson Nolen</b> - I was very disappointed hat the batter would not stay on the asparagus. Did anyone else have this problem?

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>daddyscookie</b> - I&#039;ve made this for years but my Grandma (who taught me) always coated this with seasoned flour. I have also used panko crumbs, Hidden Valley Ranch dry packets or dry soup mix. I&#039;ve done the same with fresh green beans as well. I&#039;ve never tried a batter though. Many options for great fresh veggies!
