    <b>BigShotsMom</b> - This is good but a REAL Brooklyn egg cream has 2 Tbs Fox&#039;s UBet syrup 1/2 cup whole milk and 8 oz of seltzer (not club soda!) I&#039;m not a purist about many things but this is one. Pobably because it was a special treat to go to the candy store with my grandfather for an &quot;Eh Cream&quot; Thanks for the trip down memory lane.

    <b>Sarah Jo</b> - Grandma made this exact drink for me when I was a kid. There&#039;s nothing like it. Having it again takes me right back to childhood and holding those memories again is bittersweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe so I can remember and also share this recipe with MY kids.

    <b>Joe Molitor</b> - To MB Rogers - I was brought up in Brooklyn and lived in Upper Nyack for years. For your Dad&#039;s Black &amp; White - use this Chocolate Egg Cream WITHOUT the milk and when it&#039;s foaming add a scoop of Breyer&#039;s Vanilla ice cream. On a diet? - then add Hagendaz... you only live once!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MB Rogers</b> - Dad used to take us for black and whites at the Woolworth&#039;s soda fountain as kids. Being a former &quot;soda jerk&quot; in Nyack as a kid he used to make them at home without the ice cream. I now make them as a low cal treat with low fat chocolate milk and seltzer or club soda - very refreshing and delicious! BTW - you can find them on the menu at Emack and Bolio&#039;s in Albany!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ms Jean</b> - Excellent and very refreshing! These are so easy to make that I hate to pay what they ask for them at Johnny Rockets or other such places. A scoop of ice cream wouldn&#039;t hurt either!:) Thanks Rachel.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sheryl</b> - Not nearly enough milk for me. I grew up in NY drinking these every day. It used to be closer to half milk and half selter. I adjusted the ingredients but it&#039;s hard to go wrong with an egg cream.
