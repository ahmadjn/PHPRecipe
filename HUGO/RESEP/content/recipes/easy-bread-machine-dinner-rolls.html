    <b>Laurie</b> - I made the recipe making no changes.  I guess I didn&#039;t use the sponsers flour.  I have to disagree with Noel, using the bread maker doesn&#039;t make this too much of an investment in time.  They turned out fluffy and wonderful.  I will be making this again and again and again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Casablancaise</b> - Soft delicious with just a hint of sweetness. these rolls were a breeze to make and the dough was so easy to work with. I kept all the ingredients the same but I brushed the rolls with an egg wash and baked on a parchment lined cookie sheet.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Noel</b> - Making rolls is always an investment in time and I&#039;d have to say these were totally worth it.
    </li>

    <b>Kim&#039;s Cooking Now</b> - These are light and airy and really really good! I made two modifications to the recipe: I used White Lily AP flour instead of wheat and fast acting yeast. I don&#039;t know if it was the fast acting yeast or what but these were so light and fluffy! We had friends for dinner and everyone raved about them. I formed them into 8 rolls and they ended up huge like hamburger buns! So easy to make too! I brushed mine with a beaten egg white before baking which gave a nice finish. Thank you for the recipe!

    <b>Stormy</b> - So good! with bread machine dough cycle super easy. Rave reviews from the family. Only change was used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour as I was short on wheat flour. I was a little nervous about the amount of sugar but used the 1/4 cup. Not overly sweet just right. Buttered tops before baking too. Just yummy! Will save this one for sure!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kathie43</b> - I made these for a family dinner and they were delicious! Next day I taught my daughter and granddaughter how to make them. They loved it.

    <b>rosenicole</b> - Love these rolls they are always a big hit! I prefer to halve the sugar and make them more savory - brush with butter and sprinkle with everything bagel seasoning before baking. Fabulous! They are great on their own with a little butter or to make slider sized sandwiches.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Zanib</b> - Came out PERFECT!! Light fluffy just as described. No more packaged dinner rolls! Thank you!!
