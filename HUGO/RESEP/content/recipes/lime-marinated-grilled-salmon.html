    <b>SunnyByrd</b> - Way to go whodunitdr! Even though I tweaked a teeny by using fresh ginger and garlic and fillets instead of steaks, I am giving this recipe a resounding 5 stars! This dish is CLEAN and perfect. Very refreshing to try a seafood marinade that isn&#039;t afraid to let you taste the seafood. Buy good fish and use this recipe. Thanks!

    <b>Rhianna</b> - It was very good. I&#039;ll make this again, with these small changes, from the recipe &amp; from what I did: add a little more cayenne &amp; perhaps ginger (both of which I couldn&#039;t taste); add 1-2 teasp. brown sugar for a sweetening &amp; caramelizing effect; marinate 2 hrs.; sprinkle med. coarse sea salt on the skin (of fillet) just before grilling; and cook on a MED. grill as recipe indicates.  What happened this time was I marinated for 4 hrs. and cooked it on a med.-low heat, when recipe asked for marinating 1 hour  &amp; grilling on MED. heat; these 2 factors led to a slightly too-dry salmon! So, I need to make this again.

    <b>Gitano</b> - Very good marinade, although I will marinade it longer next time and use more lime juice too. Thanks for the recipe!

    <b>Nobody&#039;sGirl</b> - Delicious! It gave the meat a slightly spicy tangy and sweet coating! I added just a pinch of red pepper flakes and in the future I would also add a pinch of salt - but this is personal preference. Started cooking skin side down (oven under broiler got rained out) flipped and poured remaining marinade over and finished cooking. Now the confession - I didn&#039;t use salmon. I used chicken thighs! It would be phenomenal on salmon. If you really want a lime kick squeeze some freeze juice on top of your plate. Mmmmm. Thanks!

    <b>emplaye</b> - This has become my go-to salmon recipe. I don&#039;t always marinate for the full hour and instead wrap the salmon in aluminum foil and grill with a little extra marinade in the packet. Makes for less clean-up no need to worry about flaking apart on the grill. Delicious and simple!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>gilligan</b> - A bit too much spice- next time I&#039;ll half the cayenne pepper and maybe add a bit more lime- but besides that this one is definitely a winner
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Connie</b> - This was a very disappointing marinade. Lime does not accentuate the flavor of salmon. We won&#039;t be making this again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lukkygirl</b> - Very good I should have marinated it longer than the hour the lime flavor didn&#039;t come through quite enough for me but the spices were delicious!! Will make again!!
