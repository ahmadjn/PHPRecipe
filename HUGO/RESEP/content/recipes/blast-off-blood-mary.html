    <b>lutzflcat</b> - I used spicy V-8 juice and my horseradish is &quot;extra hot &quot; so I didn&#039;t add the hot sauce...heat level was just perfect for me. This is good but I must admit it&#039;s not my favorite recipe on this site. Thanks KELLYJELLO for a nice drink on a Friday evening.

    <b>Bobbie</b> - This is great but I get a bit crazy by rimming the glass with a bit of sea salt. Just rim the glass with either the bloody Mary mix or with the lemon juice and dip into a bit of salt on a plate or napkin. You can also ramp up the garnish as I don&#039;t care for celery stalks. I use 1 or 2 olives a piece of bacon or small spiced sausage and a piece of dill pickle. Especially good with a really spicy bloody Mary mix.
