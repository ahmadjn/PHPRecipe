    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Chrissy DeCosmo Fessler</b> - I don&#039;t use raisins in this recipe but otherwise these are a great cookie. You have to use the cornflakes though they make the cookie!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Loves2cook</b> - If you like a cake type cookie this recipe is ok. I prefer something a little more chewy.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>jkax2</b> - I used chopped dates instead of raisins and it made the cookie sweeter. Nice option for holiday cookies the cherries add nice color to a tin of cookies.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Elizabeth B-Koch</b> - I was delighted to find this recipe! My Grandma who passed away 4 years ago always made these. The recipe has been misplaced since she passed and I couldn&#039;t find it anywhere. These cookies tend to be a bit dry but overall they have a nice twist of crunch &amp; chewy with the combination of cornflakes and fruits. I like to add a handful of candied fruits to them (besides the cherries the recipe calls for) to help them not be quite so dry.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sande Beach</b> - Best cookies ever! Awesome. Followed recipe to a T.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Diana Soyer</b> - It was perfect n crunchy with just cornflakes only. I reduce the sugar to 150gm n increase the crush cornflakes to 100g &amp; skip the milk.
    </li>
        </ul>
