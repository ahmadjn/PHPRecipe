    <b>Andrea Duncan</b> - Didn&#039;t have garlic or ginger paste so I used minced fresh garlic &amp; shredded fresh ginger + fresh squeezed lime juice, etc.  Good flavor, moist and delicious, will make again.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SUNSHN</b> - Excellent! Everyone loved this. Went great with sides of &quot;Grilled Sweet Potatoes with Apples&quot; and &quot;Grilled Portobello Mushrooms.&quot; I couldn&#039;t find Garam Masala in our area so went on the internet and found a &quot;recipe&quot; for it; Luckily I had all of the ingredients to make this &quot;India Spice Blend&quot; in my spice cabinet.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Deb Dorsey Constantineau</b> - This is an excellent marinade recipe - my chops were tender &amp; delicious - my whole family loved them! I can&#039;t wait to try it on pork tenderloin too.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CookinBug</b> - So good! I was intrigued by the blend of flavors when I saw this recipe but I wasn&#039;t it expecting it to be so delicious. I even messed up by adding the garam masala to the marinade and it still came out great. I marinated for about 6 hours. Really good served with steamed veggies and brown rice. I will make this again thank you:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Angela A.</b> - These were different and good. Next time I&#039;d probably add a little olive oil to the marinade as pork chops dry out so easily.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MaryAnne Flynn-Poeschl</b> - The chops turned out tender and juicy I marinated them for about 3 hours. I was not thrilled with the garam masala the cloves seemed to be a bit much for us next time I will use less. Good recipe a keeper!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>pomplemousse</b> - Very good pork chops! We buy pork chops at Costco and they are generally extremely thick so I cut them in half. I guess I cut these a little too thin bc bf complained they were a bit too done. But that would be our fault not the fault of the recipe. I marinated this overnight then flipped so the other side could be in the marinade. Bf grilled these when he got home tonight. I made a couple of changes: I used minced garlic (didn&#039;t feel like making garlic paste) and I don&#039;t have ginger paste so I used dried ginger. I also added some garam masala to the marinade itself mostly bc I thought I might forget to sprinkle it on the chops. I didn&#039;t grill them; bf did while I walked the dog so they didn&#039;t get sprinkled with the garam masala. So I&#039;m glad I added that to the marinade. Very nice flavor and it&#039;s enough marinade if you flip the chops but not too much so you have to throw out a lot of liquid. Thanks for the recipe!

    <b>Caroline C</b> - I&#039;ve had this in my recipe box for quite a while but wasn&#039;t too sure about the combination of ingredients. I have to admit that this was way better than I thought it would be! I followed the recipe exactly and thought the flavors blended well together. I did the chops on the Foreman grill - they cam out moist and flavorful. Thanks!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Wanderer</b> - This was a GREAT recipe! The pork chops were absolutely succulent! The only other pork chop recipe that I&#039;ve liked better was one that was baked with apples. I accidentally marinated the pork for three days so it was a little salty but very tender and juicy. I also don&#039;t have a grill so I broiled it on low for about fifteen minutes and it turned out perfectly. Definitely a recipe that I&#039;ll use again!

    <b>junglepilotwife</b> - these were good. Interesting flavor but didn&#039;t blow me away.
