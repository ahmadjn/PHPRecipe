    <b>Duckball</b> - SOOOOOO good! I had half a can of sweetened condensed milk to use up, and I&#039;m so glad I found this recipe! I did a half-batch and I pretty much followed the recipe... Although I didn&#039;t measure the peanut butter, just put a huge spoonful of it in the milk. Oh, and a hint: It&#039;s much easier to mix the milk/PB-mix and spread it over the crust if you heat it in the microwave for 15 or 30 seconds. Then in blends really easily and it&#039;s pretty simple to smooth over the base. I also pressed down on the top crust a little to make sure it would not fall apart. Wonderful! I lined the 8&quot; pan with foil, sprayed it, and it was simple to remove and cut the bars. Thanks, Sue, I LOVE this recipe!

    <b>Tia the Baker</b> - this recipe is excellent and so easy! they look great too. next time i will try white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. if you slightly heat the condensed milk + peanut butter mixture in the microwave, it helps to ease the spreading over the oatmeal base.

    <b>homeschooler3</b> - All I can say about these bars is run to your kitchen and make them now, especially if you love PB &amp; Chocolate together :o)  I followed the directions to a &quot;T&quot; and these turned out awesome!  Everyone who tried them loved them.  I did line my pan with foil so the bars lifted out easier to cut.  I stored mine in the fridge.

    <b>Kimberly Longfellow</b> - OMG! These are incredible! I didn&#039;t have any sweetened condensed milk on hand so I looked up a subsitute and it was fantastic better even than canned sw. cond. milk. 2 eggs 2 Tbl flour 1 tsp vanilla 1/4 tsp. salt 1 cup br. sugar and 1/2 tsp Baking powder. (Who&#039;d have thought that you could make your own sweetened condensed milk?) Thanks so much for the recipe! It&#039;s a keeper!

    <b>5 in family</b> - Wow. These are really good and not too sweet. My young kids gobbled these up and I have to say my hubby and I were right there with &#039;em!! I didn&#039;t measure the choc chips just added to coat the pan. Also added a handful or 2 of white chips. I didn&#039;t have all the peanut butter it called for which didn&#039;t matter. The peanut butter and cond. milk aren&#039;t hard to mix at all..just a little elbow grease.:) The recipe calls for you to allow them to cool before cutting them but I had to try them out of the oven and I think they would be awesome warm with vanilla ice cream! I will definately keep this recipe. Thank you so much!!

    <b>Ali</b> - SOOOO GOOOOOD! I only used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips because I didn&#039;t want to make the chocolate overpowering. They came out perfect. I&#039;ve tried them a few times and they always come out a little better and softer when I bake them in a glass pan instead of a metal one. I&#039;ve also used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. MMMMMmmm...

    <b>Dawn</b> - I have made these several times; they seem to work for me everytime. I make sure however not to bake them too long. This will definitely leave that burnt chocolate chip aftertaste. Watch your oven and these will definitely be a hit!

    <b>TUNISIANSWIFE</b> - these are so darned good! I didn&#039;t change anything except I don&#039;t use instant oats; I like the bigger flakes of oats that the old-fashioned rolled oats provides. Never fails to amaze me how people will rate a recipe less stars because they are &#039;rich&#039; or &#039;too sweet&#039;; all one has to do is look at ingredients to realize yes they have ingredients that produce a rich dessert bar but oh so good. Didn&#039;t have a problem mixing the milk and pb-just a few whips with the wisk and it was incorporated. Used a glass pan and no sticking at all; 30 min. was perfect. TIP to avoid browning of morsels or pb mixture refrain from spreading to the edges of pan. I had no problems. thanks for this quick and easy recipe. love it.

    <b>JOSIE</b> - These were good but a little too rich for my liking. I used a full bag of chocolate chips..(I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s more than 2 cups) but it was way too much. The chocolate overpowered everything else and made these sickly sweet. I did like the crust. It had a good flavor and I loved the oatmeal in it. Would probably only use half a bag of chocolate chips next time.
