    <b>Kathe Rich</b> - I made this recipe as is the first time and it was quite tasty without any changes.    I think if you rate a recipe you need to follow the directions-at least the first time!   I have made some changes since then.   First I use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I also use two or three carrots and an additional  clove of garlic (we like garlic).  and an additional bay leaf since I use fresh bay leaves from a tree and they don&#039;t seem very strong.  I also added about a half a cup of chopped celery leaves and a small diced potato.  Rather than removing some liquid and putting it in the blender to thicken it, I  use my potato masher and that does a fine job without having to wash the blender.
    </li>

    <b>Arbie</b> - This is a great recipe! I did make a couple of changes to fit out tastes. First, I used 1/2 fat free, low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 chicken stock for the water. 2nd, I substitted two smoked turkey legs for the pork. You can find them in the frozen foods. I just put them in skin and all, when cooking the beans (they won&#039;t fall apart that way). When they&#039;re done and cool enough to handle, discard skin, bone and fat; putting the meat back into the soup.  I used 2 carrots and 2 med potatoes chopped and upped the garlic to 3 cloves (we love garlic).  If you like it spicy, you can add a couple of chopped, seeded jalapenos! Thanks for a great recipe Jerry!

    <b>Doreen Stewart Dudden</b> - I just made this today. I&#039;ve used it as a base for my own spin. If I do not have leftover stuffing I use stove-top Savory herb flavor. I follow the microwave directions and dump it in the finished soup. I do not blend some as the recipe instructs I find the stuffing dissolves and adds a wonderful stick to your ribs thickness and flavor that is deliciously irresistible. Thanks!

    <b>KGora</b> - This is a great penny pinching meal that&#039;s simple and delicious. I added a chopped up stalk of celery along with the onion. This is a great recipe to make ahead and reheat for those busy nights. This would be great without the ham for a meatless meal or you could even substitute a smoked turkey leg for non-pork eaters.

    <b>Kristen Rasmussen</b> - Just made this during the horrible Vikings vs. Bears Football Game; Substituted 4 cups unsalted chicken stock and 4 cups Low-sodium chicken broth for the 8 cups water as some of reviewers have suggested. Also added more carrots (about 4 medium-small ones). Smells up the whole house and tastes good and will console my husband per husband.

    <b>anniegolden</b> - This was delicious.  I used 1/2 pound of dry beans and one small meaty ham hock (about 1 1/4 lb.).  Used 1 15 oz. can low sodium chicken stock and the rest water.  Added celery, increased the carrots and garlic, added 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. apple cider vinegar.  Did not add any salt. Used dry thyme leaves instead of fresh. These were all minor tweaks.  It was wonderful soup and I will make it again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe.

    <b>Loves2cook</b> - Really good. Used dried herbs instead of fresh 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water 1 lg smoked ham hock with lots of ham on it and chopped celery. Very tasty.

    <b>Paul Davis</b> - Just like my mom used to make. This is my new favorite thing to make. I changed it up to suite my own needs and tastes but they were minor and insignificant. The basic recipe is great where anyone will pleased with the results. If you try it you won&#039;t be disappointed.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Leasa</b> - The flavour was point on. But either add one cup of beans or reduce the liquid by half. I saved the extra broth to freeze for later bean soup. I simmered it for a full six hours and as is the product was more a thin bean soup than a main course bean dish. I did follow the recipe to the letter. So with the addition of more beans or less liquid I would rate it much higher.
