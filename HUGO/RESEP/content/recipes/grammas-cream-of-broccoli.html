    <b>MARMARL</b> - I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. This is the only Cream of Broccoli soup I could find that doesn&#039;t list chicken broth or chicken boullion in the ingredients (I didn&#039;t have either). Great flavor and texture and I will make this again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KELEKITCHEN</b> - This soup is superb. Used skim milk and opted to saute the onion til transparent for sweetness. I Love this soup. My new favorite. Really do not measure anything just kind of add and mix as i go. Once in a bowl add a bit of black pepper and sprinkle with grated parmesian cheese. MMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMM Good!!!!!!! Have made it 3 times in like 2 weeks. Delish!!! Brenda

    <b>SATRNTGR</b> - This was great. I was tired of all of the Cream of Broccoli recipes making you cook the stuff first and then put it in the blender that was always a mess. This one came out great!!! I added chicken broth instead of the water to the milk and it gave it extra flavor. Thanks!!

    <b>robyn devine</b> - This soup was very good and quick and easy to make! I gave it 4 stars though because i changed it a little bit. I used frozen broccoli and I used 3 cups instead of one. It turned out nice and thick! Will definitely make this again.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>The King&#039;s kid</b> - This recipe is a keeper. Made it twice with 2nd time coming out much better after some changes were made. 1st and 2nd time I used the Salad Shooter with wide blade to chop broccoli 1st time: I used 2 tsp salt (too salty for us) so cut back to 1 tsp. I served it right after making and added shredded Cheddar cheese (it took away the broccoli taste which we love). 2nd time: I used the boiled water from cooking broccoli to make the sauce using all-purpose flour (last time I used Wondra a gravy flour). After making in large saucepan I poured the soup into top pan for double boiler and let it sit covered 1 hour before serving. To warm it I put fresh water in lower double boiler pan to prevent scorching. Soup was very creamy and tastier. By the way I used 2 cups of broccoli instead of 1. Thanks for sharing with us.

    <b>Melanie Esqueda</b> - I loved it - I left out the onions added black pepper and left the broccoli in large chunks. My children LOVED it I will make it again!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SM</b> - Love it! I add instant mashed potatoes and all kinds of stuff to make it great. (Anything I can think of that I have around that looks good... noodles etc.)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Saxton Family</b> - So easy to make! Even yummier with chicken broth instead of water.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MLA1537</b> - This was a tasteless soup. I had to add cheese to thicken it up and then the soup broke. Tasted better but looked awful!!
