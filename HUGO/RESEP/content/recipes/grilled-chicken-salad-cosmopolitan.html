recipeingredient:
- "¼ cup jellied cranberry sauce"
- "¼ cup orange marmalade"
- "¼ cup fresh lime juice"
- "¼ cup fresh orange juice"
- "¼ cup vegetable oil"
- "2 tablespoons lemon flavored vodka"
- "4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves"
- "¾ teaspoon salt"
- "¾ teaspoon lemon pepper"
- "1 (10 ounce) bag European blend salad greens"
- "½ cup dried cranberries"
- "2 cups diced orange segments"
- "2 tablespoons orange zest strips"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the cranberry sauce and orange marmalade. Warm and stir until melted and well blended. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice, orange juice and vegetable oil. Remove 1/2 cup of the mixture and set aside in the refrigerator for later."
- "Allow the mixture to cool then stir in the lemon vodka and transfer to a large resealable bag. Season the chicken pieces with salt and lemon pepper; place them into the bag with the marinade. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, turning occasionally."

- "Place the chicken pieces on the preheated grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until firm and no longer pink in the center. If you have a meat thermometer, it should measure 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when measured in the thickest part. Remove chicken to a cutting board and allow to rest for about 5 minutes."
- "While the chicken is resting, combine the salad greens, cranberries, and orange segments. Pour the reserved citrus marinade over the salad and toss lightly to coat. Divide the salad between four serving plates. Slice each piece of chicken crosswise into 1/2 inch strips. Arrange over the tops of the salads and sprinkle with orange zest strips."

    <b>Thisni Caza</b> - Excellent. Wonderful fresh light flavor. I was not cooking in my own kitchen so made some subs. Some of which I would have made at home others out of necessity. Bottled lime juice for fresh; olive oil for veg; a splash of lemon juice and a splash of white wine for lemon-flavored vodka; garlic pepper for lemon pepper; chopped iceberg lettuce for bagged Euro blend; no orange zest (no zester); added one-half cup chopped pecans. When I make this again I will use fresh lime juice and the orange zest. HOWEVER...pull out soap box here...if I&#039;m going to all the trouble to use fresh lime juice fresh oranges fresh orange zest I&#039;m not going to risk all that freshness on bagged salad greens. I don&#039;t know about other cooks but I&#039;ve found them unreliable. Sometimes OK other times taste like the inside of a stale empty unused refrigerator smells. Yeah I know canned cranberries and orange marmalade from a jar ain&#039;t exactly fresh squeezed!! Bottom line is that we really like this salad!! Update: just noticed that this recipe calls for 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon lemon pepper. Check to determine if your lemon pepper includes salt already. If so either omit salt or make adjustments.

    <b>thomasg</b> - I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and omitted the salt on the chicken since lemon pepper has a substantial amount of salt already. Other than those minor adjustments I followed things as they appeared. The dressing was a bit too sugary/syrupy for my taste but the dish was enjoyable nonetheless.

    <b>Mary L.</b> - this dish is definitely a winner in every sense.........easy healthy creative and delicious!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lynn Kimmel</b> - This is fabulous combining cranberries and citrus to make a tangy delicious chicken salad.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>kelcampbell</b> - This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly and in the end didn&#039;t find the chicken picked up much of the marinade flavour (although I marinated it for about 10 hours). The dressing was good but if I were to make this again I would add some toasted almonds for crunch
