recipeingredient:
- "vegetable oil for frying"
- "1 ¼ cups milk"
- "1 egg"
- "2 ½ tablespoons butter, melted"
- "1 ½ cups all-purpose flour"
- "3 ½ teaspoons baking powder"
- "¾ tablespoon white sugar"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "2 (8 ounce) packages dates"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a small nonstick skillet on medium-high heat and add enough oil so a date can just float in it."
- "Whisk milk, egg, and melted butter together in a large bowl. Combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a second bowl. Whisk flour mixture into milk mixture to make a pancake batter."
- "Test if oil is hot enough by adding a drop of batter to the oil: batter should rise to the top and bubble around the sides, browning within 5 to 10 seconds."
