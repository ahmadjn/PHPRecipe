    <b>MATTHEW DONALDSON</b> - Since I found it this has become my family&#039;s favorite cookie recipe! I like to add butterscotch chips instead of walnuts for those who don&#039;t like nuts in their cookies. What wonderful cookies!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>AVENTURA</b> - This is a stellar recipe for hachiya persimmon cookies! I&#039;m bringing these to my family&#039;s Thanksgiving festivities because they are an incredible hit with my neighbors (who I share in the bounty of my backyard persimmon tree) and with my co-workers. I followed the recipe to the &quot;T&quot; and my goodness it is by far the best persimmon cookie I&#039;ve had since my Tia Maria made them for me as a kid growing up in Chile. Thanks again. PS: for those who don&#039;t like these too spicy take the spices down to 1/4 TS and the complaint about the &quot;black specks&quot; are due to the ground cloves. If you don&#039;t like the appearance of them don&#039;t put that spice in but the cookie will suffer their fantastic flavoring.

    <b>ShttrBugin</b> - I have to give 5 stars based on hubby; I made these at his request I had never had a persimmon cookie and probably won&#039;t try anymore.:) Not my flavor. But he RAVED about them. 3 of my 5 kids loved as well. I subbed pecans instead of walnuts and only put in 1/2 cup sugar. He&#039;s already brought home more persimmons to make some more and I only made last night. Thank you for a good recipe that I think is also healthy.

    <b>bakedbyjen</b> - I used 3 ripe persimmons and the persimmon taste was still too subtle for me. Next time I will add more. (Update - It might have been the persimmons I bought as I&#039;ve just cut open one to eat and it was gritty in taste. Also all the cookies turned soft and black the next day but still tasted fine.) I knocked the 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to 1/4 tsp as I find it an overpowering spice. 15 minutes left my first batch almost burnt! I had better results at 12-14 minutes.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Karen S.</b> - This recipe is wonderful. I was out of raisins and used dried cranberries instead. I was also out of walnuts and used 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup oatmeal as a filler. I also didn&#039;t have ground cloves and threw in some ground ginger. Very yummy and great with a glass of apple juice!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amna &amp; Sarah&#039;s Mom</b> - My step-daughter HATES persimmons but I couldn&#039;t keep these in the kitchen. In an attempt to keep some in the kitchen I told her they were made with persimmons...she laughed and wouldn&#039;t believe me. This was great. I noticed some reviews say the cookies didn&#039;t have any taste remember to use ripe mushy feeling persimmons.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MADFROG</b> - The best persimmon cookies ever! I used walnuts as the recipe indicated - excellent! The spicing is excellent as well.
