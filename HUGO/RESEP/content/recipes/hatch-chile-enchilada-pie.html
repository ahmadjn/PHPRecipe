recipeingredient:
- "6 Hatch chile peppers, sliced in half lengthwise and seeded"
- "3 tablespoons olive oil, divided"
- "2 tablespoons butter"
- "1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs"
- "2 ½ cups chicken broth, divided"
- "1 onion, chopped"
- "4 cloves garlic, minced"
- "¼ teaspoon dried oregano"
- "¼ teaspoon ground cumin"
- "salt and ground black pepper to taste"
- "½ (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained"
- "12 (6 inch) corn tortillas"
- "1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend"
recipeinstructions:
- "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven&#039;s broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil."
- "Arrange Hatch chiles, skin-side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with 1 tablespoon olive oil."
- "Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Cool; remove and discard skins. Roughly chop chiles."
- "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken thighs until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour 1 cup chicken broth over thighs and bring to a boil. Cover skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat."
- "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper in hot oil until onion is soft, about 6 minutes. Stir chopped chiles, tomatoes, and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth into onion mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chiles and onion are tender, 20 minutes."
- "Mash chile-onion mixture to a sauce consistency. Remove chicken thighs from chicken broth, reserving 1/2 cup broth. Stir thighs into chile sauce; cook until chicken is heated through, about 2 minutes."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
- "Spread a thin layer of chile chicken sauce on the bottom of an 8-inch pie dish. Arrange a layer of corn tortillas over sauce, spread another layer of chile chicken sauce over the tortillas, and sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over sauce. Repeat layering process until all tortillas, sauce, and cheese are used, ending with a layer of cheese. Pour 1/2 cup reserved chicken broth over the top."
- "Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes."

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Yoly</b> - This was good but it was missing something. Not sure what maybe sour cream in the sauce? The only thing I did different was to cut the corn tortillas into triangles.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Seth Kolloen</b> - This is my recipe--obviously it&#039;s not going to win any awards for healthy eating but it was good. I think I had thirds!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Nancy Rossiter</b> - This recipe has too many steps making it unnecessarily lengthy - does the chicken really need to be cooked 3 times? I roasted the chilies on the gas burner. I don&#039;t know about you but my pie plate is not nearly enough to hold 2 1/2 cups of broth let alone the other ingredients. Did two layers and that was about all it could hold. Like the other reviewers it was a little too spicy (but I&#039;m guessing hat really depends on the peppers which can be unpredictable) and that the 1/2 cup of chicken grease at the end is not really necessary. Shredding the chicken should be in the recipe someplace. Might make this again with a few tweaks.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kelly</b> - This is the best Enchilada Pie recipe out there! So good! I couldn&#039;t find Hatch Chilis so I used Pablonos instead but still turned out delicious and not too spicy.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Pam Taylor Greene</b> - This was delicious! Light and fresh tasting. I used Hatch Chile&#039;s from my daughter in laws garden. So good. I also used shredded chicken breast since that&#039;s what I had. It will become a regular dish here. Next time I will add the black beans. There are a lot of variations you can do with this recipe.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Riskell</b> - Was delicious! Husband couldn&#039;t quit eating it!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>laurenlindley82</b> - This dish was so delicious!! I added sour cream to the cheese layer and it made the sauce extra creamy. The next time I made it I&#039;ll probably use shredded chicken.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Steve</b> - When I make this again I will use 2x the Hatch chili sauce. Rave revues from 3 out of 4 of us. Used the hot hatch chiles &amp; must admit it was at the upper limit of my heat index (&amp; I like hot!)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>mvkunz</b> - Really enjoyed the recipe. I substituted pork stew meat for the chicken and loved it.

        </ul>
