    <b>msatta</b> - Thank you so much for this easy recipe. I promised my husband and others working with him Reuben casserole for dinner &amp; I forgot to get 1000 island at store. I chopped up some sweet brine pickles I had canned last summer since no relish on hand. Turned out great &amp; made the casserole awesome.

    <b>What&#039;s for dinner, mom?</b> - My guys thought this was pretty good. It lacks a little from some other recipes we tried but good in a pinch just the same. Gets better if you let it sit a day or two before use.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Carl Woodall</b> - Excellent. I made a one person mixture.It turned out great on my Ruben sandwich. Will definitely use again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Karen Mills</b> - I have never liked Thousand Island dressing too sweet. This was perfect and took minutes to make. I will never buy store again for my husband.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ms Jean</b> - Loved this! I didn&#039;t want to open a new jar of sweet pickle relish, so I chopped up some sweet bread &amp; butter pickles. (I did have some opened dill pickle relish which probably would have worked here, too.)  The salad dressing recipes on this site are always so much better than what you get at the store, too! You know what goes into them and you can make just the amount that you need. Thanks for a great recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Rachel Irwin Shaw</b> - I used our homemade green tomato relish and the horseradish and Worcester made it extra special. Perfect for Reubens!! Thanks
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lyle Pierce</b> - I made this just as the recipe said except for I cut it in half cuz it was just me. Instead of using horseradish I used Horsey Sauce. it&#039;s going to be yummy and my Ruben.
