    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>debruttenbur</b> - After struggling to form balls from the resulting mixture I found other recipes that scaled the ingredients differently. Reduce the crispy rice cereal to only one cup and you should have very good results. With three cups of the cereal you will have difficulty forming balls that hold together.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Donna Keel</b> - The problem other people are having with the recipe is because of the type of dates used. If you use a chopped date made for snacking it has a coating on it to keep it from sticking together. This makes them hard to melt and removes stickiness. Baking dates on the other hand come all clumped together and melt easily. Amport is a good brand. Rule: if it don&#039;t stick in bag it won&#039;t make balls.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Meredith Missroon</b> - I followed the advice of other commenters and reduced the rice crispies to 1 cup. I also changed out the margarine for butter. Finally I bought chipped pecans because the chopped ones at my store weren&#039;t chopped enough and I didn&#039;t want to fool with chopping them. I made them for a ladies tea party event and they seemed to be a big hit.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Peggy</b> - My husband said they tasted exactly like the cookies his grandmother made when he was a little boy.:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Glory Gooding</b> - after misplacing my usual Date Ball recipe I gave this one a try. very tasty but like others the mixture is too dry. I aborted trying to roll it into balls after the second one and pressed it into a 9x13 like Rice Crispy Treats and dusted with powdered sugar. crumbly but very good!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>pathays</b> - Unable to roll into balls. Not sure what happened. I&#039;m going to melt marshmallows and pour over dry mixture to see if they can form into balls.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Aubrey Iacobelli</b> - 3 stars for frustration level. Read the reviews and scaled sugar back to 3/4 cup crispies to one cup and I still had the crumbliness going on when trying to form the balls. Pressed it into a pan like one reviewer suggested: nope fell apart. Pressed it into mini cupcake tins: nope fell apart. Refrigerated it in the the hopes that the fat would solidify to bell hold everything together: nope fell apart. As I was about to chuck it out in frustration I remember that dates are naturally sticky so I threw the mixture into a food processor and voila! Sticky dough perfect for rolling. It wasn t nearly as crunchy as before so next time I ll try processing everything but the crispies then mix those in by hand afterwards. Also my personal preference is they are still way too sweet. I ll try cutting sugar back even more.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>joan</b> - tastes good but I think the rice cereal needs to be crushed instead of whole.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Joan</b> - It is impossible to make balls with this recipe. There is way too much Rice Krispies in the recipe. You should redo it or remove it.
    </li>
        </ul>
