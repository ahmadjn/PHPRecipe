    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - These turned out really good. After reading over the recipe I knew I was going to make one change to suit us. I completely left out the sugar and I&#039;m glad I did. Between the rolls jam and honey mustard these were plenty sweet. You don&#039;t need the sugar in my opinion. I found Hawaiian mini hoagie bread rolls and they worked good for this too. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Vyn Cent</b> - Considering that the rolls are sweet as is the honey mustard the jam not to mention most hams are sugar cured I do not see why any more sugar would be good for this recipe. I would most likely even reduce the jam or substitute fresh berries and then as a side to accompany this dish rather than add them to the sandwich.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Carole</b> - I thought these were delicious! I made two substitutions.  I used grape jelly and no sugar.
