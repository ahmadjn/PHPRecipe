    <b>kymbrown1</b> - I made this recipe almost exactly as directed with only a couple of very minor changes.  One, I diced the peppers instead of cutting them into strips and later quartered the tomatoes since that made them mix into the couscous much easier.  Second, I cooked the peppers only until tender and not until charred since I don&#039;t like the charred flavor.  Other than those simple differences, I made it as the recipe calls for and it was very delicious!  It was really good both hot right after cooking and the next day as a cold salad.  I highly recommend this recipe and will post a photo the next time I make it if no one has posted one by then.

    <b>Janice</b> - We all liked it. Had 2nd helpings. Spouse said if you have to eat cous cous...... So a 3&amp;1/2 rating. Would make it again.
