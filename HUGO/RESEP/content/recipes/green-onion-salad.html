    <b>QUASINAUGHT</b> - I was skeptical about adding all the onion so I only added half. This would be really good with all the onion so next time I will add all of it. I liked the crackers in it also. Thanks for posting!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PAT7377</b> - Great taste! I added a touch of horseradish to give it a kick.

    <b>carltond</b> - Very different and a good recipe! I think next time I will add another egg or two. I also added a few squirts of mustard and it made a world of difference! I didn&#039;t add the saltines I used this as a sandwich spread. Very good!

    <b>MBKRH</b> - I didn&#039;t expect this to taste that great but it was pretty darn good. I added a bit of crushed black pepper to mine. It was a good light dinner for me tonight thanks.

    <b>Caroline C</b> - I liked this but you need to eat it as soon as you make it - it gets soggy fast. Thanks!

    <b>Sarah Jo</b> - This is pure comfort food to me. It&#039;s no different than the basic egg salad my mom made for us kids and spread on saltines for a quick and cheap lunch only it&#039;s a little lazier. My kids love it just as much as I did at their age which totally tickles me. I don&#039;t add as much onion as the recipe states just a few real big stalks of green onion and the amount of mayo is really purely up to the makers taste. I like to eat this with a little hot sauce a little garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Like the recipe says it&#039;s best eaten right away while the crackers are still crunchy and it&#039;s best with a cold Coke.

    <b>deborah1118</b> - This side dish is so easy... and so good. Perfect for Easter when thanks to the kids hard cooked eggs are abundant! Try light mayo for a little less guilt.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Eva</b> - This is my favorite salad and I have made it for years. I add tomato to mine and it makes it even better. If you are taking this on an outing you can take the crackers seperately and add them when you are ready to eat it.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KatyPurviance</b> - This was surprisingly good! My husband hates mayo so I made it with plain youghurt instead. I also added black pepper to taste. And instead of adding crumbled-up crackers we ate it spread on crackers.
