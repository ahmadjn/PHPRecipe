recipeingredient:
- "3 cups peeled and chopped peaches"
- "¾ cup water"
- "1 (1.75 ounce) package fruit pectin (such as Sure-Jell®)"
- "½ cup sucralose sugar substitute (such as Splenda®)"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a canner pot half-full with water and bring to a simmer. Wash jars and rings in warm soapy water; rinse with warm water. Place lids in a saucepan off the heat; pour boiling water on top. Let stand until ready to use."
- "Measure 3 cups of peaches into a 6- or 8-inch saucepot. Stir in 3/4 cup water. Gradually add pectin, stirring until well blended. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Boil exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in sucralose. Skim foam off the surface of the jam using a metal spoon."
- "Ladle jam immediately into the prepared jars, filling to within 1/8-inch from the tops. Wipe jar rims and threads. Cover with lids and rings; screw bands tightly. Place jars on an elevated rack in the canner. Lower the rack to cover the jars with 1 to 2 inches of water, adding more boiling water if necessary. Cover and bring water to a simmer."
- "Process the jam for 10 minutes. Remove jars and place upright on a towel to cool completely, 2 to 3 hours. Check seals by pressing the middle of lid with your finger; if lid springs back, lid is not sealed and refrigeration is necessary."
