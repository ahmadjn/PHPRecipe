    <b>Joanne Neubauer</b> - Ok I haven&#039;t tried it yet but I&#039;m sure its gonna be a five star I was just wondering what do you think about FRESH Cranberries.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kevin K</b> - If you exchange all the dried ingredients with fresh (and halve the oil), you get a much tastier, more vibrant dish.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - I&#039;m torn on how to rate this recipe fairly but I am giving it a 4 for taste. I did use less sugar as the recipe submitter mentioned but that is not where the problem came in. The problem for me was what color the cranberry mixture turned in the food processor. I assumed the brightness of the cranberries would overpower the green of the peppers leaving me with a pretty red/pink sauce. Wrong. Instead I ended up with a very off putting color and one that was not appetizing. I ended up chopping more pepper and cranberries to add to the dish to make it a little more  visually appealing.  The cranberry mix was pretty when it came off of the stove so my suggestion is to dice the dried cranberries prior to putting them on the stove and then skip the whole blending process.

    <b>Rebecca V</b> - I did not care for this recipe.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>lora baccus</b> - Fresh cranberries are a must too. Makes ALL the difference. Pulse them with cilantro and jalapeño.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jen Monacell</b> - This was amazing!! I ended up shaping it into a cheese ball. It would have been excellent rolled in nuts. Everyone at my party asked for the recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>karenfar</b> - too thick and too sweet.

    <b>Heather Waidelich-Zinda</b> - I added a bit more jalapeno&#039;s but it was fabulous!!! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy.
