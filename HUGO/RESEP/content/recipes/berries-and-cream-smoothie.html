    <b>TeaLover767</b> - This makes a delicious but spoonable smoothie rather than a sippable one. I brought -as is - to work but saved half for when I returned home. I then thinned it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk after also straining the seeds through a fine-mesh strainer. I used a mixed berry frozen blend rather than individual types.
