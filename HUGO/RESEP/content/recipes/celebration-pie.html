    <b>Tanya Belt</b> - I first found this recipe over a year ago and when I made it everyone loved it! It&#039;s quick it&#039;s SO easy it&#039;s extremely versatile and it&#039;s very inexpensive. My Mother in law now makes this pie quite frequently and a sister in law is always requesting it. Our favorite is strawberry although we have made lemonade and lime (a quick easy key lime tasting pie!) and our most recent &quot;berry blue&quot;. It is a VERY sweet pie so if you don&#039;t like intense sweet this isn&#039;t for you. But if you&#039;re wanting to try something different and the thought of &quot;eating&quot; kool-aid intrigues you--give it a shot!

    <b>PATTYDUFF</b> - This sweet recipe is incredibly quick and easy. I used strawberry drink mix and added 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice. Everyone loved it. I look forward to making many variations on this easy theme when I need an easy pleasing dessert... LOL did I mention how easy this was?
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CHARLOTTEB1</b> - This is probably the simplest pie that I have ever made. It was very good and considering the amount of effort involved it was excellent. Thanks Maggie. I will definitely make it again. Oh I used kiwi-lime drink mix and my husband thought that I had made a key lime pie. I also made one using chocolate sweetened milk ( I don&#039;t think that it available any longer) and cherry powdered drink mix. It tasted so much like chocolate covered cherries. Such fun!

    <b>KIMBER_SYT</b> - My strawberry loving 2 year old loved this. My mom loved it too and asked for the recipe. This is great when you need a dessert but you don&#039;t have a lot of ingredients on hand. The only thing I would suggest is to decorate the pie for presentation purposes - with whipped cream piped around it for example. Thanks!!

    <b>Wayne12182</b> - This was a good pie recipe. For how easy it was it was a GREAT pie recipe. I used lemon lime and it came out really nice. Although next time I will cut down on the amount of condensed milk.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Wonder Wanda</b> - This was very easy to make but tasted awful to me (I used Kool-Aid lemon-lime flavor packet to make a &quot;key lime&quot; pie) and it just had a nasty sweetish &quot;powder&quot; aftertaste. Also it was very gooey and messy even after I kept it in the fridge overnight. To be fair both my boyfriend and his roommate liked it but I wouldn&#039;t make this again except maybe for little kids.
