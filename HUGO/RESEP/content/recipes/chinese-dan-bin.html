    <b>Robert Barlow</b> - This should be labeled breakfast burrito. A true Taiwanese Dan Bing uses a scallion/ flour dough. You should be able to buy Dan Bing Pi (Dan Bing skin) at any of your local Asian Markets. Also you can put anything you want in a Dan bing but should limit it to 2 fillings.

    <b>Dreygan</b> - Very good recipe! Was wonderfully simple as well. We left out the bacon as we don&#039;t do meat and put salsa and sour cream over the top. My girlfriend wasn&#039;t expecting to really like it but we just ate it for the second night in a row by her request. Might add onion next time. The diced chilis I&#039;ve seen mentioned in other reviews would be good as well I think.

    <b>gooberette</b> - Very tasty! I just go without the baccon because most of the time we don&#039;t have any. Sometimes I will mix ketchup and garlic paste and use that for the sauce. I eat these for breakfast all the time!

    <b>Caroline C</b> - Husband didn&#039;t go crazy over this one - said it would be better with flour tortillas and without the corn. Won&#039;t be making this again but thanks anyway.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MikeTheChef</b> - A great new way to make eggs especially if you have extra corn tortillas lying around that you don&#039;t know what to do with. I used ham to make these (I obviously had to add a little oil); they had a perfect balance of flavor.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Christine</b> - A good fast meal (though I&#039;m not sure what is Taiwanese about it...). I tried it both as-is and with cheddar and sour cream and it is much better at least with the sour cream. The addition of corn received mixed reviews in my house but I personally liked the texture it added. It could be made even easier by just adding a tablespoon or so of real bacon bits to the egg.

    <b>~TxCin~ILove2Ck</b> - This is even better than migas! I&#039;ve tried these with corn and without my hubby likes better with the corn my son likes better without...I liked both ways. Sometimes I also add a slice of american cheese to ours. SO many options for add ons to this one such a great idea! Thanks for the wonderful recipe I&#039;ve made these too many times to count. My hubby&#039;s suggestion maybe add green chili&#039;s for some kick.

    <b>ORVILLE76</b> - This was one of those recipes that just hit me aside the head...I was not sure what to expect. It really is pretty good and it is sure easy. I was skeptical about the corn and didnt use it...I added some diced green pepper instead. But after tasting them I think the corn would have been a nice addition complementing the flavor of the tortilla. I also topped the bacon with cheddar cheese and garlic and herb cream cheese instead of the salsa. This was a good flavor but next time I am sticking to the recipe (while still adding some cheddar). It is easy-breezy and different...mandarin-mex? lol!
