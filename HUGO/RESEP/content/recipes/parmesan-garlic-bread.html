    <b>caliboo</b> - Made some changes that brought this up to a five star rating!  One, don&#039;t melt the butter, soften it.  Then mix the other ingredients {I omitted the rosemary  and left out the garlic salt in favor of additional garlic powder} in the with softened butter and spread on the bread.  When you have only five minutes of baking time left, add a liberal amount of mozzarella cheese to the top.  After five minutes it will be just melted and nice and gooey when you take it out of the oven!  Perfect!!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Stephanie Louie</b> - The flavor of the butter is absolutely delicious on the French bread. I will, however, omit the garlic salt next time as it is too salty. This recipe makes more than is needed for one loaf of bread (probably just the right amount for one and one-half to two loaves).
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sarah Jo</b> - I cut this recipe in half, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I used sandwich bread that needed to be used up. (Ghetto? Sure. But it works just as any other bread would.) Family thought this was very tasty. I did not have any, I just looked at it with longing.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>RWFINS</b> - My family loved this didn&#039;t have a french loaf just some &quot;wonder&quot; slice bread slightly toasted the bread and then put spread on both sides and cook about 5 minutes longer then the recipe called for let sit a couple of minutes it turned out great. Oh yeah the most important thing use unsalted butter that way when you use the garlic salt it will not turn out too salty.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JJBURKE81</b> - This is the BEST garlic bread I&#039;ve ever tasted!!!! The only changes that i made were to just soften the butter instead of melting it....it spread much easier and i also added more parmesan on top before i baked it. I will definately used this recipe again and again!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>skram</b> - I thought that this recipe was great. I didn&#039;t have any garlic salt so I just used more garlic powder and it turned out perfect!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KATMARNIN</b> - I thought this was good except it was too salty. Next time I would cut the garlic salt in half and add more garlic powder.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Valerie Brunmeier</b> - Great garlic bread.  I recommend using more garlic powder (3/4 tsp.) and less garlic salt (1/2 tsp.).  Otherwise good as stated.  This way it will be more garlicky than it is salty which is how we like it.  It was gobbled up at a recent bbq.  Thanks!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PAMMMY</b> - I made this recipe last weekend for a dinner party. It was AWESOME! The one reviewer who said it didn&#039;t have the right combination of spices must have done something wrong because this is the best and easiest garlic bread i&#039;ve ever made! Also the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of butter which is one stick not two as one reviewer said. The rosemary gives it it&#039;s unique flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and added just a scant bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese on top. This is my new &#039;bread&#039;! Thanks for sharing.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MILDRED5</b> - When making garlic bread for my grandchildren I use hot dog buns. I finish spliting them and the kids love them. They are easier for little hands to hold.
