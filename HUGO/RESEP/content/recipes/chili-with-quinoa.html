    <b>Tammy</b> - I loved the quinoa as a meat substitute but the recipe itself could definitely use more spices. It tasted heavy on the tomato and too bland
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jenni6578</b> - The flavor was good and it was simple to make. My 3 meat loving boys all ate it without a pause. You could easily add ground beef if you HAD to have meat. I could stand it a little spicier but that&#039;s a personal choice and easy to adjust to your own liking with some red pepper flakes or a Serrano. Thanks ill make this again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Richard A. Sanders</b> - I have made this recipe twice and enjoyed it very much thank you for posting it. As for the spices everyone should spice to taste.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tammy Lynn</b> - It was much too saucy and too bland for our tastes. I upped the chili powder and cumin and added black pepper cayenne pepper and oregano. I stirred some shredded cheese into it before serving which helped with the overly tomato flavor. I think a green pepper would add some color and flavor as well. It&#039;s OK as a base recipe for us. It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve tried quinoa in chili and it gave me a good idea what to do next time.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>sfox1530</b> - This is my new favorite &quot;go-to&quot; meal for my family! We have tried other meatless chili recipes and none came close to this one in flavor texture or nutrition! I doubled the recipe so I could share with friends and have leftovers. Love it!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Thomas Scappaticci</b> - I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and doubled the beans. My carnivorous family loved the vegetarian twist. Using quinoa is a great substitute for ground meat. Next time I&#039;m going to add bell peppers and maybe some roasted corn.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>peterm319</b> - Simply delicious. Easy to make. I was amazed how great using quinoa adds to the texture. Hearty meal that will definitely make again
