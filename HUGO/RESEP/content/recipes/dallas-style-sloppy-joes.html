    <b>GaterChick</b> - This is a great recipe! The family loved it! It&#039;s quick and easy. The only things I changed was due to it being too tangy I added 1/4 cup white granulated sugar I omitted the salt and worcestershire sauce and added 1 tablespoon minced garlic instead. I let it simmer for about 45 mins and it turned out great! Thanks for a great recipe...I will be making this again!

    <b>CARODUN</b> - Good recipe. A lot of ketchup, but turns out very good. To make it a little spicier, I added a teaspoon of cayenne powder. I let it simmer for one hour and made it one day before. The meat became more &#039;sticky&#039; after half an hour simmer. 
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>~TxCin~ILove2Ck</b> - These were very tasty very saucy almost too saucey though... I had to simmer this 45 min to get it reduced/thickened. Plus it needed the time for the flavor to develop. Tangy flavor zesty with some zing but not too spicy or sweet or tomatoey a nice blend of all. I scaled this back to 1 lb of beef. I used 2 Tbl dried minced onion and 2 heaping Tbl. of diced pimento pepper in the jar Head Country bbq sauce which didn&#039;t have hickory so I put in a couple of drops of mesquite liquid smoke (the only kind I had on hand). I used about a half tsp of sea salt 1/4 tsp celery salt and 5 or 6 grinds of black pepper and a tsp of paprika to go with the pimento since I didn&#039;t use fresh sweet red pepper. I buttered the buns and grilled them til they were toasty and golden topped with sloppy joe filling and a slice of american cheese this made a nice filling lunch and I had plenty of leftovers for another meal. These were even better after I reheated the leftovers. I almost gave this a 5 based on what I reheated but the original recipe only says to cook these a few minutes and they certainly would not really compare with my final product. Fabulous recipe I&#039;ll certainly use this again. Thanks so much for posting this one!

    <b>rhonda</b> - Yummy flavors! I used 1 tbsp of tomato paste &amp; 1 sm can of tomato sauce with 3 tbsp of ketchup. Then used 1 tbsp of each of the remaining ingredients except BBQ sauce which I used 1.5 tbsps. I also used a green pepper in place of the red. Definitely will make again!!
