    <b>kajira</b> - Excellent... Very tastey...** Ok a few notes.. I leave it up to you....

- I did the mix, all wet ingredients and then all dry
ingredients... A normal muffin like mixture. 

- I used brown sugar in place of regular sugar, taste
better..

- I also used 1 cup of regular flour and  1/2 cup
whole wheat.. I imagine you can use all whole wheat,
if you like. Up to you...

- I have to bake them for longer than 17 mins, I baked
them for 20-25 mins and they were perfect. 

- I also added 1/2 teaspoon NUTMEG, as I ran out of
ALLSPICE. :-)

Ok.. those my notes...

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Laurel Harvey</b> - A quick easy muffin. Few changes: Used all butter all brown sugar did half whole wheat and half all purpose flour added 1/4 tsp. vanilla and 1 small finely chopped apple raisens and 1 Tbsp. Wheat Germ. This made 18 medium size muffins. It&#039;s a keeper
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SPELPH</b> - Wow, this recipe was so easy and my 3 year old loved it.  I lowered the butter by half and added a touch more applsauce.  I didn&#039;t have allspice on hand, so I used cinnimon and ground cloves.  I also used cinnamon applsauce.  Very tasty and healty treat.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>GRANNYLOOHOO</b> - I used another reviewer&#039;s suggestion &amp; made 6 jumbo muffins; I added 1/4 t. salt and a streusel topping and they were delicious. My husband thought they were great and suggested I add nuts next time. I love the texture and even though it is reminiscent of spice cake it has a nice texture and that good old-time muffin flavor. I will definitely use this again as mini-muffins for my grand-kids and also try it as a coffee cake in a 9&quot; baking pan. I gave it 5 stars for taste texture &amp; versatility.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CookinMama</b> - Delicious! Especially straight out of the oven! Due to personal preference I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flours and all brown sugar (this just screamed to me that it wanted a touch of molasses). To lighten this up I might even try using 1/2 butter called for and subbing in extra applesauce. But some butter needs to be here--it completely adds to the flavor! YUMMY! Thanks!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>REIVEX</b> - Tried these out for my kids&#039; school snack and they were great! Whole family loved the flavor! After reading the reviews &amp; checking what was in my kitchen I made these changes: used 1/4 cup unsalted butter substituted 2/3 cup brown sugar for white sugar substituted 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for the allspice (didn&#039;t have any). For the batter: 1) mixed butter brown sugar eggs and applesauce 2) separately sifted together dry ingredients 3) pour wet mix into dry mix and stirred just until blended. Recipe made 24 mini muffins. Next time I will: use 1 cup all-purpose flour &amp; cup whole wheat flour use either chunky applesauce or add chopped apple pieces.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SASSY74181</b> - I changed a few things 1/2 the amount of margarine and added 2/3cup of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. of allspice instead of the whole amount.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>RENEEGAGNON</b> - I love this recipe for my picky one year old. There isn&#039;t pieces of fruit for him to pick out but he still gets the fruit. I always substitute a third of the white flour for whole wheat flour (1/2 cup in this recipe). It gives it more texture and nutrition. The second time I made them I used a packet of Kashi&#039;s instant apple and cinnamon oatmeal instead of the the spices called for. Plus it adds the healthy oatmeal that my son won&#039;t realize is in there. They came out so good he won&#039;t be the only one eating them!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JAMIMASMOM</b> - Yum! Simple to make &amp; just the right size for a different type of bread or muffin to add to a nice dinner party or brunch!
    </li>
        </ul>
