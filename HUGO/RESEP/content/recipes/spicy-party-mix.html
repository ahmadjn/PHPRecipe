    <b>France C</b> - Very tasty and hard not to eat too much! Spice lovers will really enjoy this! I just wish there was more variety in the mix but that is easily customizable. I did appreciate there not being any peanuts since that is always my least favorite part of chex mix! I used pretzel sticks instead of mini pretzels because that&#039;s what I had on hand. I also baked the mix at 230F instead of 250F because my oven tends to run a little hot. I also only baked it for about 50 minutes instead of 1h15 and the mix was perfectly browned. Next time I might cut back a bit on the seasoning salt since it was a little salty.
