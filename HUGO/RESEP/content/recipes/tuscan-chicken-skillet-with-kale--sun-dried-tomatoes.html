    <b>sunnybluesky</b> - The first to review how fun! I did not change anything it&#039;s very tasty. And pretty. However... the preparation for this does not work well. If I made this again I would: 1. cook the chicken set aside 2. cook the rice by itself according to package directions 3. cook the garlic and kale then just toss it all together.
