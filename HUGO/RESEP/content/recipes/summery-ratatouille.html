    <b>Dede Ranahan</b> - Sometimes I don&#039;t understand the ratings on this site at all. This recipe is a case in point. Agree with the reviewer who said he didn&#039;t like the taste or texture of the ground pork. Simple vegetarian Ratatouille is much better. Call this something else.

    <b>Kiss1frog</b> - CREATOR&#039;S COMMENTS: When I make this dish I do not crumble the ground pork; I make semi-rough meatballs about 1/2 thumb size. That way not every bite has pork in it. Also I have found that using Ritz brand crackers makes a better &quot;crust&quot; with the cheeses.

    <b>rosejohanna</b> - This was delicious! I used Italian Turkey Sausage in place of the ground pork. I also used Garlic and Herb Wheat Thins (Reduced Fat) for the cracker topping. The combo was perfect! This was a complete meal by itself.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>amyjprice</b> - I substituted japanese eggplant for the bell peppers and used an ice cube of basil instead of the dried seasonings. Also used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the crackers. I got 6 servings out of it and served it with some basmatti rice. Very good!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MAmommy</b> - This was absolutely delicious! I made it for company the other night and even my father -- who hates vegetables and tomato dishes -- raved about it. I used reduced fat crackers and omitted the bell pepper due to taste preferences but it was still great. Spicier than I thought it would be so I may use a bit less pepper next time.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Cookingforfun</b> - This was excellent. Great flavor.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LED87</b> - This was great. In order to make this a complete meal I added some ziti. I added eggplant because I had one that was about to go bad. I had enough drippings from my italian sausage so I didnt have to use the olive oil. After the vegetables and sausage cooked I heated my cooked ziti and pasta sauce up. I then did the layering. This recipe does take some time because of all the chopping cooking stiring layering cleaning. But I thought it was worth it. It took me nearly an hour for prep...not 30 minutes like the recipe stated. And by no means am I a slow cooker! Great dish!!

    <b>BOOKIE MYERS</b> - 3 2 14 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/146044/summery-ratatouille/ ... Since the movie &quot;Ratatouille,&quot; (yes, I&#039;m one of those) I&#039;ve tried a few recipes.  I found one I liked today.  :)  I didn&#039;t use any meat.  Used 2 green peppers since they were small.  &#039;Not sure how 1 large &amp; 2 medium squash works out, but I put in 4 zucchini.  Also added half an eggplant (a few minutes after the zucchini so the zucchini could release some moisture).  I accidentally added 15 oz sauce with one can of diced toms.  &#039;Added those after everybody else was cooked.  Ha.  &#039;Took the suggestion of adding pasta - 1/4# bowties.  I layered, but don&#039;t think I will next time.  &#039;Used about 2c mozzarella &amp; less than one cup parmesan.  &#039;Didn&#039;t do the crumbs, just cheese on top.  Kids willingly had some when they saw familiar pasta, but still picked through, but ate.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Note: the heat intensified after day one - probably too hot for most kids.

    <b>Carrie Causey</b> - I turned this into a one-pot meal by using an extra large cast iron skillet to cook everything in then put the whole thing onto the oven! I tried this recipe last night with a few modifications because of what I had on hand. I used 1 lb. ground beef 1/2 lb. sausage in place of the pork and 1 jar spaghetti sauce in place of the tomatoes and added some red pepper flakes. The flavor and texture were both really good! The only thing I didn&#039;t like was the crumb topping. Way to powdery in the mouth. I scraped it all off before saving the leftovers but on that note - it reheats perfectly! Next time I&#039;ll reduce the crumbs to 1/2C. but still use all the cheese. Overall I&#039;ll make this one again!
