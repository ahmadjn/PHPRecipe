    <b>SHARON8799</b> - Like a lot of people, I change almost every recipe to suit my family&#039;s taste and this was no exception.  My only changes were to par-cook the chicken with some spices, could only find a 12-oz can of milk so I put the whole thing in, and stirred the stuffing into the wet mix before spooning it over the chicken.  My husband loved it (said, &quot;Three thumbs up&quot;) but he&#039;ll eat anything that doesn&#039;t get up and walk away.  My super-finicky 6-yr-old: TWO servings!  That NEVER happens.  Yep, this is a keeper!  The only thing I&#039;d do differently next time is to make one of the cans of soup a low-sodium type.  We like salty stuff, but this was a bit much, even for us.  Otherwise, a perfect dish!!  (Did you read that part about my youngest eating TWO servings?  TWO!!)

    <b>MELODY JUNE</b> - This is one of the easiest receipes I&#039;ve found. I bake boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the morning while I&#039;m getting ready for work (30 - 40 minutes max).  When I come home I spend 10 minutes putting the entire casserole together and just pop it in the oven.  This has been one of the more requested dinner menu&#039;s now!  My son asks me to make a double receipe as he likes it so much he wants it for lunch the next day! A true favorite!

    <b>bracystake</b> - Very tasty recipe and simple. I enjoy the texture of fresh vegetables in my stuffing so I added diced carrots celery and onion to the mix. I also used unseasoned stuffing. To enhance the flavor I salted the chicken added salt and pepper to the liquid ingredients as well as a good tsp each of rubbed sage thyme and basil. Turned out great!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PattyJoy</b> - I used this recipe as a springboard for my own version.  I simplified preparation by using canned chicken breast meat, cut into tiny chunks.  Sometimes I make my own stuffing from left-over home-made whole wheat bread cubes, tossed with melted butter and poultry seasoning, (which I make myself from a recipe on this site), and sometimes I just use the &quot;off the shelf&quot; stuffing mix.  I usually add some fresh vegetable or other, (last night it was broccoli), and add it to the water and butter that&#039;s melting in the pan to be added to the stuffing mix, just to give the recipe a nutritional, color, and texture boost.  If I think it needs more moisture, I make my own home-made &quot;cream soup&quot; and pour it over the top and shake it through.  If I have any grated cheese handy, (just about any kind works!), I sprinkle that on the top, too, before baking.  This has become one of my kids&#039; and husband&#039;s favorite recipes.  Left-overs are great!

    <b>KRISTY916</b> - Very good and very easy.  I adapted this recipe slightly by 1) using a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken (and once, a pre-cooked rotisserie turkey breast)and using canned broth in place of the boiled chicken water. I simply pulled apart the chicken and kept some aside for sandwiches and such, and chopped the rest of up for layering into the casserole; 2) in addition to the crunch of celery and veggies, I scattered craisens (dried cranberries) onto the stuffing mixture. They absorbed the liquid of the casserole and became soft and tender, but held their intregrity, for a bit of sharp cranberry contrast which for me, completes the &quot;Thanksgiving in a hot dish&quot; flavor combo. 3) Evap Milk was not required. I&#039;ve used milk and also FF half and half. The finished texture of this casserole is not &quot;stiff.&quot; It&#039;s rather soupy, like a very thick Chicken Pot pie mixture, so don&#039;t expect anything you can &quot;slice.&quot;

    <b>Claire</b> - This is very good. I&#039;ve made this a few times and it always gets rave reviews. I&#039;ve experimented with adding different soups and have never had a bad outcome (cream of mushroom is a good one to sub for the cream of celery). I usually also just use chicken breast meat instead of a whole chicken. Great recipe! Thanks:)

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>GODDESS77</b> - I love this recipe! It makes great comfort food! However, I like to use Campbell&#039;s &quot;chicken with herbs&quot; soup instead of the cream of chicken and cream of celery.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>bug177</b> - Love this recipe! I make it even simpler by stirring dry stuffing mix with a little water and the 2 cans creamed soup.Then stir in cubed raw chicken breast, transfer to a casserole and bake. I serve with canned cranberry sauce and it tastes like thanksgiving with only ten minutes to prep!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Linda</b> - Like a previous reviewer I used the breast tenderloins rather than the whole chicken. Otherwise I changed nothing about the recipe. The 4 children (ages 5-12) were raving about it and had 2nd helpings - a rarity for the youngest. Without a doubt this is a KEEPER!
