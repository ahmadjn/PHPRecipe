    <b>Mama B</b> - This is easy to make and delicious!  My husband, who doesn&#039;t even like spinach, yummed this up too.  I loved it as-is.  My husband would have liked more of a sauce to pour over the rice.  He used a bottled Thai sauce as an immediate fix.  Would love anyone&#039;s suggestions of a great, easy sauce to make to pair with this!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Charles Manning</b> - I have made this a couple times really good recipe. only thing I did different is I used velvet chicken. I love this recipe
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>rocky</b> - We really enjoyed this dish. I read other reviews before I started cooking and I made little changes to make more sauce. Marinade was made of 3Tbl spoons soy sauce 2Tbl spoons water and 1Tbl spoon sugar. I drained chicken and saved marinade before I fried it in 2Tbl spoons of oil. I poured marinade back to fully cooked chicken just before I added spinach. I think any other sauce would ruin the unique flavor of this very good recipe.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jonathan Boling</b> - I have actually made this recipe on several occasions and I see a fair number of people that said the chicken was a little bland; however, I have found a way to spice the chicken up a little. 

I bypassed the marinade all together and spiced the chicken with curry, pepper, and cooked the chicken in a Thai Curry paste, Soy Sauce, and sesame oil instead of olive oil.  

I used about a teaspoon of Thai Curry paste and unless one likes their chicken really spicy, that is all I would add.

I used only a tablespoon of sesame oil because if much more is used it will have an overpowering sesame flavor. 

Thirdly, I added a tablespoon of Soy Sauce. 

Heat the sesame oil, Soy sauce, and Thai curry paste in the pan before any chicken is added as to dilute the curry paste.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Cindy Kettle</b> - Excellent! I doubled the recipe. Marinated the chicken while I prepped the veggies and basil.  Used my wok, perfect for stir-frying.  Cooking order: garlic, then chicken and marinade, then veggies.  Next, spinach, then basil, without removing from pan.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>disue</b> - very good
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>mihokj</b> - This was really yummy! I echo the review of another view who would have like to have more sauce but I also served it over sticky rice and it was delectable! Love love love all the basil. I didn&#039;t have enough spinach on hand as the recipe called for but it was fine the way it was.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Linda T</b> - Yummy dish.. the basil really gives it a nice and different flavor from most stir fries. Will add some red pepper flakes to leftovers tonight
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jane and Rich</b> - While we enjoyed the spinach/basil combo the chicken was bland &amp; boring. We&#039;ll make this again but use a different marinade for the chicken.
    </li>
        </ul>
