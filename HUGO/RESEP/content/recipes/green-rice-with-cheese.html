    <b>Yoly</b> - Creamy cheesy and fluffy rice. The only addition I made was to add chopped onions when I sauteed the rice. I used Hatch chiles in place of Poblano chiles only because they are in season. Very good will make again.

    <b>Trish-the-Dish</b> - We liked this green rice and had it for Cinco de Mayo.  The poblano chiles give it just the right amount of heat and flavor.  The rice  was a bit sticky though, but it may have been my fault as I didn&#039;t rinse the rice first.  The recipe doesn&#039;t say to rinse, but I know that rinsing reduces the starches and therefore the stickiness of the rice.   I will do that the next time I make this side dish.  I give it 4.5 stars!
