    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - My parsley had gone bad on me so I garnished with cilantro. Parsley would have definitely been better in this but my review is not based on the garnish. Salami is salty as it is and browning it really brings out the saltiness Even with leaving the salt out of step 1 this recipe was entirely too salty. I did like the flavor combo of the salami oregano and parm but I don&#039;t know how to get all 3 together without the end result being overly salty tasting. I recommend starting with just a sprinkle of cheese instead of 1/3 cup for starters.

    <b>Hannah Nathanson</b> - I made this with julienned Genoa salami and it turned out well. It reminds me of a pizza topping
