    <b>naples34102</b> - This really does taste like French Silk Pie! I was both surprised and impressed! (And I couldn&#039;t stop tasting it, telling myself I had to make sure it was sweet enough, chocolatey enough, the proper consistency, etc., etc...yeah, right) It is light, fluffy, and mildly chocolate - just like French Silk Pie! It spreads like a dream and makes the cake look like you just have to dive right in for a piece.  Wanting to make sure I had enough to amply frost a layer cake I scaled the recipe to 18 servings and it was just the right amount.  Using pre-melted unsweetened chocolate in the envelopes made this a snap to make quickly. Didn&#039;t have milk but I had cream leftover from &quot;Whipped Cream Cake II&quot; and it worked well.  Awesome good frosting.

    <b>Megan Orsini</b> - THIS IS THE BEST BEST BEST FROSTING!!!! There need be NO other chocolate frosting recipes after this one! Also it is TOO easy to be so smooth and delicious! Most chocolate frosting recipes are too thick and heavy but this is very close to the flavor and texture of French Silk Pie! I LOVE THIS FROSTING! It frosted and filled my 8 inch layer cake well and I added just a splash more milk...I might double it for a 9 inch layer cake cause it&#039;s SOOOO GOOD!! Truly outstanding...light and chocolaty!

    <b>PastryChefNYC</b> - I&#039;ve been making FRENCH SILK FROSTING for over 40 YEARS since the recipe came out in 1964 in Betty Crocker&#039;s &quot;FESTIVE FIXINS WITH A FOREIGN FLAIR&quot; and below is the ORIGINAL RECIPE which will make you flush the one given here down the toilet! It is better than sex! 4 CUPS SIFTED POWDERED SUGAR 1 CUP SOFTENED BUTTER (OR MARGARINE) 1 EGG 3 SQUARES BAKERS UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE MELTED &amp; COOLED (MAY ALSO USE 3 PACKETS OF REDI-BLEND CHOCOLATE) 1 TSP VANILLA EXTRACT BEAT ALL INGREDIENTS UNTIL LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND SPREAD ON COOLED CAKE. YIELD FROSTING FOR 2- 9 INCH LAYERS. ENJOY!!

    <b>Lauren Koblara</b> - This is really tasty first time for me making frosting so I think it came out really well. I didn&#039;t have bakers chocolate so i used baking cocoa and added more milk... didn&#039;t hurt the frosting at all. very yummy!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LoriAnn</b> - This is my family&#039;s all-time favorite frosting! This was my first time making it....my mom always frosts our birthday cakes with this and my son asked me to make a yellow cake using this frosting. I couldn&#039;t find the recipe....I don&#039;t have the old Betty Crocker book that my mom has so I was thrilled to find it here! It turned out great on my Bonnie Butter Cake. I too had to add about 3 TBS more milk...I made a batch and a half for a 9&quot; layer cake...my boys LOVE frosting:) Thanks for the recipe!

    <b>MURPHI1216</b> - Recipe was fairly simple to make but it was a bit dry. I would suggest adding a splash more milk. The taste got rave reviews though.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jog Dish</b> - Great with black magic cake!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MIDGEN109</b> - This is to die for frosting. I used margarine in the recipe instead of butter. I think this would be great with butter.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SUZZANNA</b> - This frosting is smooth silky and delicious! It&#039;s very easy to make and it makes enough to generously frost and fill a 9-inch layer cake. The best thing about this frosting is that it&#039;s stiff enough use for piping decorations.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Princess Di</b> - No disrespect this is the traditional sicky heavy overly sweet American Buttercream. I was so disapointed after reading the rave reviews thinking this was something special. Ah well. If you like oversweet frosting this is for you. Again I DO appreciate the post and will return to the French cooked egg cream with a tenth of the sugar.
