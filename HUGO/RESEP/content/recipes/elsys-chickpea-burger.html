    <b>Jennifer Korpak Bechtel</b> - Wow...these turned out delicious and with an excellent texture! I made the recipe with 2 drained and rinsed cans of garbanzo beans. (Turns out the equivalent should have been 4 cans!) Because of my accidental omission the patties were a bit sticky to work with but then they cooked up beautifully. We ate with tomato slices and avocado slices. If you like it spicy add a little bit of hot sauce after or cayenne (sparingly) while mixing the ingredients together. Also great with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Delighted and can&#039;t wait to try again!

    <b>Buckwheat Queen</b> - Wow! These do have amazing flavor even though I used less garlic. The result is a lovely patty that is so flaky and crispy on the outside it melts in your mouth. The inside is moist and tender but holds up to a knife and fork. It goes very well with guacamole. Thank you for this fantastic recipe.

    <b>ESTEPHAN</b> - I have tried alot of bean burger recipes, and alot of chickpea burger recipes, and this one is the leader by far! Some clarifications in directions would be helpful, such as: how many cups of cooked chickpeas do you get from the dried chickpeas? do you drain the chickpeas before adding? Maybe because I didn&#039;t drain aggressively, but my mixture was very, very wet, and I added about 3/4 cup of panko crumbs to help it to hold together. With this addition, it had a wonderful texture and held together in very wide patties while I pan fried them and ate them. It has a definite falafel vibe going on, so I served with a sort of garlic mayo-tzatziki sauce that I made up. Yum!

    <b>Ary</b> - Great recipe! Very Easy and flavorful. Just a little oil spray in a hot pan.
