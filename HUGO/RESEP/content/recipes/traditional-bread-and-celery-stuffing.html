recipeingredient:
- "3 cups turkey broth, or as needed"
- "¼ cup butter"
- "1 medium onion, chopped"
- "1 loaf white bread"
- "1 (10 ounce) package saltine crackers"
- "1 (6 ounce) box turkey stuffing mix"
- "3 stalks celery, chopped"
- "nonstick cooking spray"
recipeinstructions:
- "Empty 2 cups of broth and butter into a medium pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook for about 20 minutes."
- "While onions cook, tear the bread into a very large mixing bowl. You don&#039;t want large pieces of crust or heel. This part of the bread doesn&#039;t absorb as well. The regular bread parts can be torn into large pieces, about 4 pieces per slice. Don&#039;t mush the bread, tear easily. Squeeze and crush the crackers in the sleeve and empty into the mixing bowl. Empty all contents of boxed stuffing into the bowl."
- "After the onion has cooked, add the celery. Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes, turn heat off, and let cool, 10 to 15 minutes."
- "While your mixture is cooking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and spray a roasting pan with nonstick spray."
- "Empty one ladleful of stock at a time over the bread. After each, use a fork to softly fold/fluff the bread mixture. Don&#039;t stir or mash. Bread tearing while folding/fluffing is okay, but you don&#039;t want it mashed up or doughy. Then, add more broth to the mixture, fold/fluff, and wait about 30 seconds for absorption between adding more. The stuffing should hold together and be moist."
- "Empty mixture into the sprayed roasting pan. Using your fork, softly fluff over the mixture until it covers the pan. Add little amounts of broth at a time and use the fork to pick up/fluff until you just start to see it not absorbing. Cover the pan with aluminum foil."
- "Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until lightly browned, about 5 minutes more."
