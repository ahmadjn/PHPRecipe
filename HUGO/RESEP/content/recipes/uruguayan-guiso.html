recipeingredient:
- "3 links chorizo sausage"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 ½ pounds cubed beef chuck roast"
- "1 onion, diced"
- "1 leek, white part only, chopped"
- "4 cloves garlic, minced"
- "2 cups diced butternut squash"
- "2 potatoes, diced, or more to taste"
- "2 carrots, diced"
- "3 cups water, or as needed"
- "1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce"
- "1 cube vegetable bouillon"
- "1 tablespoon ground oregano"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "salt and ground black pepper to taste"
- "2 cups ditalini pasta"
- "1 cup frozen peas, thawed"
- "1 cup cooked lentils"
- "½ cup chopped fresh parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, turning occasionally and pricking each link with a fork to release some of the fat, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove sausages and slice when cool enough to handle. Set aside."
- "Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Add beef and cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add reserved sausage slices, onion, leek, and garlic and saute until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in butternut squash, potatoes, and carrots. Add water and tomato sauce. If vegetables are not covered with liquid, add more water to cover."
- "Add bouillon cube, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until stew thickens up, about 1 hour. Add pasta, peas, lentils, and parsley. Cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. You may need to add more water at this point, since the pasta will absorb liquid and the stew may become too dry."
