    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kari Petrelli Dom</b> - This was just ok. It tasted kind of like a cheeseburger but the lettuce and veggies just did not stay crisp at all despite being added right at serving time.  I also think the soup was just way too rich and it really needed more than just the meat and the minimal veggies. My 6 year old didn’t like it at all and the rest of my family thought it was ok.  I wouldn’t make it again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tracey Ruic</b> - I didn t worry about pushing the meat down into the bottom of the pan I just browned it and went from there. This was such a good soup!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Krystal</b> - I added garlic and left off the bacon and lettuce. It was not a big hit with my kids unfortunately. I liked it but most likely will not make it again since I would be the only one who ate it.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Debbie DeFevre</b> - I  will definitely make again. I followed the recipe exactly and turned out totally yummy. Tasted just like a cheeseburger.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Trisha Wolfe Rarick</b> - My husband and daughter and I loved this and we even had seconds. The only thing I would do different is maybe add two pounds of ground beef instead of one. Otherwise it s delicious!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Leslie Peabody</b> - The whole family loved it. I didn&#039;t have a few ingredients like the mustard, steak sauce or  tomato paste so I improvised with the closest things I had. Added chopped garlic, mustard powder and some sea salt.  Went lighter on the chili powder. Threw on extra toppings: avocado and 5% greek yogurt dollop. So good!!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Chuck</b> - Tastes just like a bacon cheeseburger!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Susan Boss</b> - Very rich and filling.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>christopher lowrey</b> - This was delicious! I made it as directed except for I used iceberg lettuce(I missed romainewhen I was shoppin) my daughter is super picky and she loved it! I will be making again!
    </li>
        </ul>
