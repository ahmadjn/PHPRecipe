        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>DebRhae</b> - This is a very excellent tuna salad recipe and I have been making almost the exact recipe for many years!    After slicing my apple off of the core, I dip in lemon juice to keep it from browning.  I also like to throw in a little chopped celery and use chopped red onion.  The red onion and apple combination - mmmm!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tammy Lynn</b> - Very good.  I&#039;ve had apples in chicken salad but never in tuna--it worked!  After making as written I found it a little dry for my taste, so I doubled the mayo and pickle relish.  I just used a dash of salt and pepper.  Yum!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kim Weber</b> - This was a very good recipe.  I did add a lot more mayo though because without it the recipe was way too dry.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Valerie Weiler-Hinch</b> - Great flavor and love the added touch of the apples!! Added shredded carrot for extra color/flavor/texture. I was out of onion so added onion powder/flakes which I prefer any way for a smoother tuna salad!! Went well atop my salad for lunch @ work!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JJDsMom</b> - Really great. I made it per the recipe. The pic shown has to have more than 1 T of mayo. Mine didn&#039;t look like that at all. But it was really good and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll make it again and again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>dlamb</b> - Wonderful.  Double the mayo and add 1/4 cup of pecans and it is perfection!  Serve on toasted bread with lettuce and a thin slice of tomato.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SESQUIUS</b> - My husband absolutely loved it. Wasn&#039;t to sure about the apples in his tuna but he said they added a nice crunch to the tuna salad. Thanks for the recipe!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Scotdog</b> - This was surprisingly really good. I tend to like tuna the way I grew up on it &amp; don&#039;t usually stray from that. But I had a juicy apple sitting there and I thought &quot;what the heck&quot;. Since I&#039;m only making one serving I halved the recipe. They must make tuna cans smaller because mine is 5 oz. I used the white albacore in water. I wasn&#039;t sure what to think of adding olive oil but I really liked it. I did use a bit less and added more mayo but I like the subtle flavor of a good olive oil in there. I used a bit less apple because it seemed to be too much for the amount of tuna. I only had dill pickles so I used a bit less dill. It&#039;s a really nice change of pace from my normal tuna salad. Thanks for sharing!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>tracylynn</b> - This recipe saved me on a day when I was out of celery and we liked it with the apple! I did add some slivered almonds for a little extra crunch.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>kellieann</b> - This was ok for something different but it&#039;s not something I would make again. The dill was too overpowering for my taste.
    </li>
        </ul>
