    <b>BRENDA MARVIN</b> - This recipe is really salty unless you rinse the dried beef with water. It tastes really good when served with round bread
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KJB357</b> - Made this last night for New Years Eve. Everyone loved it and there is very little left. I used a rye bread bowl because that is all there was at the store and it was good. The only change I made to the dip was I added 2 tsp of creamy horseradish to give it a little extra kick. I will make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Souper Mom</b> - Sorry I even rinsed the beef and it was still WAY too salty. I think part of the problem is using that much italian seasoning....maybe half would be better and use the Buddig beef packages that are much less salty.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amanda</b> - Absolutely yummy!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>DC776</b> - It&#039;s very good but very salty i should have read the reviews and rinsed the beef to see if that helped. I&#039;m going to try adding more sour cream and mayo to tone it down. Next time I would chop the dried beef even finer since it thickens as it sets it&#039;s hard to get it on the bread pieces.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sarah</b> - This was the WORST recipe. I do not recommend it at all!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>D STEINMETZ</b> - Make sure you wash the dried beef as it is way too salty. Thank you.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>sally</b> - Way to salty even for us salt lovers
