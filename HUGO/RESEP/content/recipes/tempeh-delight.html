        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>AKBRUSH</b> - I m in agreement with the other reviews. The flavor is lacking something and the texture is very dry. I did try increasing the garlic but it didn t really help. Maybe it needs something tart like citrus. I will not be making this again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Diane Robison</b> - I agree with Jordan. Did you ever figure out what needed to be included to give it a bit more pizzazz? Do you think swapping out the olive oil with sesame oil would help?
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Joe Jordan</b> - Rather boring. A modified version of this recipe with something to add a bit more moisture to the mix would be appreciated. Will experiment and post with results.
