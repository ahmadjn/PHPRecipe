    <b>michael</b> - I made this so quick Ididn&#039;t even add to recipe box right away. I used this sauce over the memorial weekend and the chefs put it on the ribs hamburgers crab cakes shrimp and chicken. I was asked to bring it to the family&#039;s fourth of July picnic and and outdoor wedding. Thank the heavens I was able to add it and print it or I would have been exiled. THANK YOU THANK YOU for your recipe and web site

    <b>FSU_NOLESFAN2</b> - I have been looking for a sauce this good for a long time.I used it on babyback ribs in my smoker and they were the best we had by far!!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>AMY11</b> - GREAT SAUCE ESPECIALLY ON RIBS ADD ALITTLE HOT SAUCE TO GIVE IT AN EXTRA ZING.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KBots</b> - Yummy! I knew my fiance would not touch this if it was chunky at all so I threw all the ingredients in the blender and whirred it up! I added a little more soy sauce and garlic than called for. Delicious!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sunshine fun</b> - Gosh this was good. A nice change-up from the usual bottled BBQ sauce (although we like Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s so much I did use it as the base in this recipe). Great marinade!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Arizona Desert Flower</b> - I was unsure about the mixture of barbeque sauce salsa and soy but it worked really well! I cut back on the soy but I should have used the whole thing. I used mild salsa but this would be great using hot sauce and honey barbeque sauce for a sweet/hot kick. Will be using this sauce again! Thanks!
