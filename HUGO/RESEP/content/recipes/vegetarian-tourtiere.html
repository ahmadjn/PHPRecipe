    <b>Jen Wijnker</b> - Tastes great. The recipe however leaves out where to add a third of the ingredients! My amended Step 3 is: Stir the texturized vegetable protein and vegetable flake mixture in with the mushroom and onions. Mix bread crumbs pepper sea salt thyme savory cloves and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add bread crumb mixture into vegetable mixture. Pour the beer into the skillet with the vegetable mixture; remove from heat and cool. I used 1/4 tsp marjoram and 1/4 tsp sage instead of savory. I also used a frozen pie crust and only used 2/3 of the filling inside the pie. Fantastic with cranberry chutney!!

    <b>PreachersKid</b> - I was given a box of beef-style TVP and was floundering around looking for something to make. This recipe was very very good. Beware! Most refrigerated pie crusts contain lard. Mrs. Smith&#039;s is the only brand I&#039;ve found that doesn&#039;t.

    <b>Darryl</b> - I&#039;m not vegetarian but I do eat vegetarian meals once in a while. I have to admit though this vegetarian tourtiere leaves something to be desired. I always wanted to find an excuse to try TVP but never could find a use for it. Having tried it however I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be eagerly awaiting another opportunity. Looks like ground meat but tastes... uh unique. To make matters worse half the recipe instructions are missing. Thanks Jkalea for your step 3!

    <b>Mary J. Gatslick</b> - This is a good recipe despite the fact that it is a little disjointed. My niece is vegetarian and I am always looking for something to cook for her when she comes over. The beer you choose does make a big difference I went with heavy winter lager very distinct taste. I will make it again with a different beer.
