    <b>Jacolyn </b> - Loved this recipe! The chicken was tender and moist inside with a crisp crumb coating (I used Panko crumbs) and it paired greatly with the roasted red peppers and asiago cheese. I definitely ate more than I should have! Plus it only took a half hour to throw together.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>andreabree</b> - So easy! So delicious!!! I used the same pan and tossed the peppers in to warm
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Scott Page</b> - The sauce was easy and delicious
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Dave W.</b> - Great recipe. Before going into the oven I added a couple of spoonfuls of canned diced tomatoes over each chicken breast added slices of an oven-roasted bell pepper sprinkled some dried basil and oregano over everything then topped it all with Parmesan cheese (didn&#039;t have Asiago on hand). Served it over pasta.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Todd Shryock</b> - I thought this was a very good recipe and made no changes when I made it.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lori Schreiner</b> - I used vegan chicken and with this recipe it came out great.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kirsten Finnigan</b> - Very pretty. Tasty but I&#039;d do a Panko crust next time and season more heavily. Somewhat time consuming but could be started and finished later if company were coming. Served with Fettucine with a Trader Joe&#039;s Pomodoro Sauce.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kathleen</b> - I sautéed mushrooms till they were dry and steamed broccoli till just about done separately. Did not use egg or breadcrumbs (eating carb free) used rosemary s&amp;p and garlic powder while sautéing the chicken. Sprayed a glass baking dish added the cooked chicken the warmed peppers mushrooms and broccoli around the chicken topped with some cheese. Broiled till cheese was golden. Came out great.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Shelley M.</b> - This was extremely easy to make and a very good basic recipe. I followed the recipe as written the first time and simply wanted to add a little extra seasoning. I would recommend adding some additional herbs depending on the side dish (since we used pasta I added some dried basil and oregano I would also like to try adding some rosemary or cayenne to change it up).
