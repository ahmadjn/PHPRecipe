1. Product Description
_______________________

This class can be used to parse large XML files (it works with small one also) fast and with minimum of memory consumption.
It can parse any valid XML and convert it to an array.
You can parse any part of the XML as it supports XPath with the same performance as parsing the entire XML (well, a little bit faster as it’s less data to parse)
